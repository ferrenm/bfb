<p class="epi">[T]he gods were &hellip; a mere side effect of
language evolution and the most remarkable feature of the evolution of
life since the development of <i>Homo sapiens</i> himself. &mdash;
Princeton psychologist Julian Jaynes.
</p>

<p>The epigraph is possibly the most disruptive sentence ever written. As philosophical insights go, it encapsulates ‘the single most comprehensive, wide-ranging, imaginative[, and explanatory] hypothesis <a class="fn">available’.<span>
	Bob Meyers (2006) ‘Julian Jaynes: Gods and voices’ <cite> Numenware 2006-01-15</cite>.
</span></a> It gives fair warning of heavy going and strange ideas.
Jaynes&apos;s &lsquo;bicameral hypothesis&rsquo; &mdash; which he
himself called &lsquo;preposterous&rsquo; {84} &mdash; appeared to
psychologists like Athena stepping full grown from Zeus&apos;s skull.
They were unprepared for this irruption and did not take kindly to it.
Most preferred to ignore it, then and now. Most people, not wanting to believe it, will find ways to reject it: As the (recommended) <a class="fk"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">Wikipedia
article</a> says, ‘The hypothesis is generally not considered of
practical importance by mainstream psychologists’.
</p>

<p>The hypothesis was elaborated in the most important book of the 20th century, Julian Jaynes&apos;s <cite>The Origin of
Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</cite>. A title
like that will scare off many readers, and what he had to say was so
difficult to swallow that the consensus among those who most needed to
understand his insights was, ‘If we ignore him sufficiently, maybe he will go away’.
</p>

<p>An <a
href="https://www.functionalneurology.com/materiale_cic/224_XXII_1/
_the%20bicamiral/"> analysis</a> 30 years later &lsquo;adresses two main critical issues: the neurological basis of the bicameral model, and the philological accuracy of Jaynes&apos;s arguments&rsquo;. Brutally compressed, these arguments come down to this:
</p>

<ol class="de">
<li>&lsquo;[F]rom an evolutionary perspective, it seems very unlikely that &hellip; a dramatic remodelling of extensive neural networks could have come about in the space of three millennia or so&rsquo;.<br>

<li> &lsquo;[C]onsidered as a whole, the narration of the <i>Iliad</i> is not always consistent with [Jaynes&apos;s] thesis.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>To these charges I would respond:</p>

<ol class="de">
<li>The change was not evolutionary but developmental; thus societal rather than molecular. A change in childhood environment is sufficient to initiate the transition. There are still many people who are partially bicameral.</li>

<li>A sentence away from this complaint one finds: ‘The <i>Iliad</i>
is a collection of oral poetry composed by a millenary succession of
“aoidoi” or bards from different traditions, and then assembled around 700 B.C.’ &mdash; suggesting that one should not anticipate consistency
from a collection assembled over the period of the ‘breakdown’.</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, we now know that there were intimations of a need
for a bicameral explanation, never fully articulated, at the turn of the
last century. If we start with these, they may make bicameral theory
more accessible. After all, what Jaynes proposed was a Committee of Two, an Executive and a Worker, corresponding, perhaps, to the 2 hemispheres of the brain. Freud had founded a whole profession on a Committee of Three: Superego, Ego, and Id (a repackaging of Plato’s Spiritual, Rational, and Appetitive, aspects of the soul) which might in some way correspond to the 3 layers of the brain. In later chapters we will suggest that bicamerality was an early operating system of the wetware, so that a short  analog of Jaynes&apos;s hypothesis is:
</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Bronze-age bicamerality : Axial-age introspection :: 1978-Apple DOS : 2018-MacOS Mojave</b>.

<p>At this point it is useful to remember that mind-sets die hard. Psychiatry had enthusiastically trotted down Freud&apos;s garden path without noticing that Freud admitted that his ideas depended upon the validity of Lamarckian inheritance (and were thereby falsified). Forty years after <a class="fn">Bell &amp; Weinberg,<span>
	(1978) <cite>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</cite> (Solomon &amp; Schuster, NYC).
</span></a> the profession <i>still</i> allows its members to charge for doomed attempts to change people&apos;s sexual preference: this is malpractice by any standard. So too with the mind set of religion: contradictory dicta can&apos;t all be right, but the usual way we address differences is to talk past eachother, or throw rocks. Jaynes offers a civilized compromise, in which each religion can claim some measure of validity. One is entitled to feel that conscious, rational, beings would sieze such an opportunity to move forward.
</p>

<p>The gods that Jaynes deals with are revelatory gods who instruct individuals. He is silent about other sorts, such as deist gods who set the universe in motion and do not thereafter tinker with it. We in the US are fortunate in having based our <a class="fk"
href="http://libertymagazine.org/article/the-tangled-web-of-ceremonial-deism">national theology<span>
	Eugene Rostow, the dean of Yale Law School introduced the term &lsquo;ceremonial deism&rsquo; in 1963 to refer to practices that are &lsquo;so conventional and uncontroversial as to be constitutional&rsquo;.
</span></a> on the deism of the Enlightenment. To the extent that this remains true, Jaynes&apos;s disruptive hypothesis should leave us unperturbed.
</p>

<a href="#id.Bk"><h3>Consciousness </h3></a>
<a class="tri" href="#1.5">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>

<p>While our concern is the nature of the gods, rather than the nature of consciousness, the topics are so interwoven that we need to clarify what we mean by ‘consciousness’. Even though it is an evolutionarily  recent addition to the human experience, it is so interesting and elusive that it has been analyzed from many angles, acquiring thereby a  confusing overlay of properties and consequent descriptions. The upshot, I suggest, is that the ancient problem of consciousness has been polymuddled:</p>

<ol class="de">
<li>by a multiplicity of definitions, and</li>
<li>by biting off more than it needs to chew.</li>
</ol>

<p class="epi">Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. &mdash;
&lsquo;Charge!&rsquo; cried Becula.</p>

<p>What <i>is</i> &lsquo;consciousness&rsquo;? We possess it, rocks
do not, and we debate the dividing line. Some will claim that rocks have
the rudiments; others, that the unexamined survival-oriented life of
most humans is unworthy of the term. There is a host of words that get
confounded with consciousness, so for the sake of clarity, I suggest the
sequence below, which constrains &lsquo;consciousness&rsquo; to a
specific process, perhaps still mysterious, but precisely defined. This
is important, because once we blur the definition &mdash;</p>

<blockquote>&hellip; once we acknowledge that consciousness comes
in very many forms, we have to allow a role for the generation of these
various types of consciousness by [the aggregation of] items that lack
the types [of consciousness] in question. &mdash; <a class="fn">Frank
Jackson.<span>
	(2006) &lsquo;Galen Strawson on panpsychism&rsquo; in G Strawson
et al, edited by A Freeman <cite>Consciousness and its place in
nature</cite> (Imprint Academic, Exeter UK):
	62&ndash;64.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">and this can only compound the confusion. Nine items
in this list are specifically distinct from consciousness, and the fewer
of them we talk about at once, the clearer our discussion becomes. Note
as you read that the italicized components seem essential to their
definitions.
</p>

<ol class="de">
<li><b>Reactivity:</b> Even rocks react to their environment, by
metamorphism, erosion, dissolution, etc.</li>

<li><b>Awareness:</b> Perception of external events through
<i>specialized sensors</i>. (Plants have sensors aware of gravity,
sunlight, temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub>, trace nutrients, insect
attack, signal chemicals, and sometimes touch.)</li>

<li><b>Attention:</b> The focussing of sense perception; this is an
automatic response to threats to survival. Root-connected trees spread
an alarm after insect attack on one.</li>

<li><b>Intentionality:</b> Will, desire; the ability to have
thoughts about something &mdash; even at the level of DNA. Ivy
&lsquo;wants&rsquo; to become arborescent by climbing trees and
smothering them.</li>

<li><b>Intelligence:</b> Independent of consciousness, but
requiring a <i>modifiable structure</i> to retain learning. (DNA does
this too slowly to qualify except in an evolutionary sense.) </li>

<li><b>Subjectivity:</b> Sufficient individuality to be influenced
by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions. Some cats like peanut butter,
others corn-on-the-cob. Some cats swim in the ocean.</li>

<li><b>Sentience:</b> Subjective perceptual experience; response to qualia. (<a class="fn">Purring cat).<span>
	Purring is expensive. A cat who purrs for no reason is
announcing &lsquo;Free meal here!&rsquo; to any passing predator. Purring is a social signal, largely to kittens and humans: &lsquo;I judge that we are safe here. Curl up and nap.&rsquo;</span></a></li>

<li><b>Self-awareness:</b> Passing the mirror test, which normally
divides into 4 levels:
	<ul class="ucirc">
	<li> social responses (aggressive display)</li>
	<li> physical inspection (looking behind the mirror)</li>
	<li> repetitive mirror-testing behavior</li>
	<li> realization of seeing themselves</li>
	</ul>
Tests with animals are mixed. Some African Grey parrots, great
apes, ants (!) and cetaceans apparently pass; cats, dogs, jackdaws and
most primates seem to fail.
</li>

<li><b>Consciousness:</b> The ability to introspect, retrospect, and imagine.</li>

<li><b>Sapience:</b> Wisdom, a rare and valued quality in which
information is tempered with insight.</li>
</ol>



<p>At this point, it may seem that we have defined away most of the mental properties that have been associated with consciousness. Therefore I let Jaynes, speaking to an audience of professional psychologist, describe what remains (a decade after his book):
</p>

<blockquote>Subjective conscious mind is an analog of what we call the real world. It is built up with a vocabulary or lexical field whose terms are all metaphors or analogs of behavior in the physical world. Its reality is of the same order as mathematics. It allows us to short-cut behavioral processes and arrive at more adequate decisions. Like mathematics, it is an operator rather than a thing or a repository. And it is intimately bound with volition and decision. &mdash; Jaynes (1986) {146}
</blockquote>

<p>Before we continue, let us pause for a moment beside a window in a  zoo in Holland. On the other side of the glass is a warm and humid bit of the midlevel of a South American cloud forest: trees, vines, sloths, marmosets, algae. The algae recognizes tree bark and sloth fur as suitable moist and stable habitat. The sloths and marmosets are not aware of eachother. The marmosets&apos; internal clocks run 300 times faster than the sloths&apos;. Marmosets need to eat more or less constantly; sloths, once a month. Marmosets run along sloths the way they run along branches. The sloths, moving at breakneck speeds compared to the branches, don&apos;t notice.
</p>

<p>The worlds that sloths and marmosets are aware of &mdash; their internal representations of the environment &mdash; are very different, and neither of them resembles our version. Yet none of these is incorrect: each abstracts the important bits and presents a working analog model of what is essential to survival. <b>A critical difference between human and other animals lies in the form of internal representation.</b> Before we had language, with its infinite flexibility, we constructed our internal analog of the environment out of photo albums and scent arrays and audio recordings. Our deepest thinkers (e.g., Roger Penrose) appear to construct their internal analog worlds in terms of equations, at a level of abstraction which is hard for mere mortals to follow.
</p>

<p>To summarize, when the term is applied to humans:</p>
<p class="flu"><b>Consciousness</b> designates a 3-component internalized analog of the real world, consisting of:
<ol class="de">
	<li>A mind-space, wherein </li>
	<li>An analog &lsquo;I&rsquo; </li>
	<li>Narratizes (<i>manipulates</i> <a class="fn">linguistic analogs<span>
	Jaynes offers an idiosyncratic description involving <i>metaphiers, metaphrands, paraphrands,</i> and <i>paraphiers</i> which after <i>n</i> readings and 40 years remain too fuzzy and unfamiliar for me to explain briefly.
</span></a> of reality) to:
		<ul><li>introspect; contemplate, rank, and select alternatives; analyze options; evaluate choices; anticipate reactions; and make decisions. The mind-space is also decorated (and here I extend Jaynes&apos;s image) with the pictures, scents, sounds and slogans of the earlier approach, for the attention of the linguistically challenged who don’t notice the bookcases, such as cats and <i>hoi polloi</i>.
		</li>
		</ul>

	Jaynes mentions in passing some additional properties of consciousness, to replace the earlier list of things-consciousness-is-not :

		<ul class="ucirc">
		<li><b>Concentration:</b> the &lsquo;inner&rsquo; analog of external perceptual attention;</li>
		<li><b>Suppression:</b> by which we stop being conscious of annoying thoughts, the analog of turning away from annoyances in the physical world;</li>
		<li><b>Excerption:</b> the analog of how we sense only one aspect of a thing at a time;</li>
		<li><b>Consilience:</b> the analog of perceptual assimilation.</li>
		</ul>
</ol>

<p>Three additional thoughts:</p>

<ul class="udisc">
<li>If this reads a bit like <cite>The Matrix</cite>, there may be a reason.</li>

<li>Consciousness-as-introspection is entirely dependent upon the prior possession of <a class="fn">language.<span>
	I find it difficult to imagine what goes on in the minds of those who don’t notice the bookcases.
</span></a></li>

<p>While we are defining things, note that among the various analogs is another set, not mentioned by Jaynes, which philosophers have found very puzzling. These are</p>

<li><b>Qualia</b>: (Singular: qua-le). Mental representations
of phenomena detectable by instruments, acknowledged by our
cortex as convenient and our emotions as suasive, but having no
external reality other than as naming conventions for sections of
various neurally detectable continua. Among them: the color of
Capri&apos;s <a class="fk"
href="http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/Research/compvis/Metamerism/Metamerism.htm">Blue<span>
	There are an infinite number of spectra which are interpreted by the brain as the same shade of, say, blue. Choose the single wavelength that best matches the perceived color: then spectra that are symmetrical about that frequency will be mapped to it, as will departures from symmetry that are nevertheless equally weighted in both directions. Clicking will get you the best website I’ve found, but it’s not a patch on Wyzecki &amp; Stiles <cite>Color Science</cite>
</span></a> Grotto, the sound of the <i>Lost Chord</i>, and the
fragrance of your lover&apos;s hair.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without qualia, we would experience the world in monochrome, and life without nuance &mdash; but they too are distinct from consciousness, and need not puzzle us further.

<a class="tri" href="#03" >&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>

<p class="epi">The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of
explaining how and why we have qualia or phenomenal experiences — how
sensations acquire characteristics, such as colors and tastes
(Wikipedia).
</p>

<p class="epi">[T]he defining features of mental states and events,
features like their intentionality, their subjectivity and their
conscious experiential quality, seem not to be comprehensible simply in
terms of the physical operation of the organism. This is not just
because we have not yet accumulated enough empirical information: the
problem is theoretical. We cannot at present imagine an explanation of
colour perception, for example, which would do for that phenomenon what
chemistry has done for combustion &mdash; an explanation which would
tell us in physical terms, and without residue, what the experience of
colour perception is. &mdash; <a class="fn">T. Nagel (1993)<span>
	‘What is the mind-body problem?’ <cite>Ciba Found Symp. </cite>
<b>174</b>: 1&ndash;7.
</span></a></p>

<p>There are several aspects to the hard problem, and (for me) the problem goes away if these are considered in the correct order, which is:
</p>

<ul class="udisc">
<li><b>Why do qualia exist?</b> The more <a class="fn">realistic<span>
	In a qualitative sense: Honeysuckle (harmless, tasty) should smell pleasant; hydrogen sulfide (deadlier than cyanide) repulsive.
</span></a> our interior map of the world, the better our chance of surviving to reproduce.
<li><b>How are they created?</b> Understanding how the brain processes nerve impulses from sensors into qualia may be a long-term project for neurologists, but it is &lsquo;only&rsquo; signal processing.
<li><b>Why are the internal signals interpreted as they are? (Why is an optical wavelength of 475 nm seen as blue?)</b> There is no answer except &lsquo;because it works&rsquo;: our mapping of color, taste, and smell is arbitrary and idiosyncratic. We can never know how others perceive qualia.</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, I see the &lsquo;hard problem&rsquo; as hard only if it assumes that your blue is my blue because we agree on the name.    This is assumming too much. The problem faced by the first predators was finding prey (after the first blind cropping of the primordial grass). They required information about the environment, the invention of sensors, and ways of using the signals from those sensors. If you say &lsquo;signal processing&rsquo; to a communication engineer, he responds <a class="fn">&lsquo;transforms&rsquo;,<span>
	KG Beauchamp (1987) <cite>Transforms for Engineers: A Guide to Signal Processing</cite> (Oxford)
</span></a> which are ways of moving between the dimensional domains of space/time and frequency.
</p>

<p>Example: An incoming audible signal is an additive superposition of frequencies which can be represented by a single wiggly line of sound pressure vs time. What we need for survival, instead of that wiggly line &mdash; if we hope to find breakfast and avoid becoming lunch &mdash; is a spatial map of particular frequency patterns characteristic of prey and predators. Enter the Fourier transform, which separates sound into its component frequencies &mdash; a function performed mechanically by the coiled cochlea of the inner ear. Add binaural hearing, microsecond differentiation of phase between the ears (plus odd reflecting contours in them), and we can differentiate between a chicken off to the right (lying loudly about where she just laid an egg), and our clumsy fellow hunter crackling twigs behind us.
</p>

<p>While ears and cochlea resolve the aural signal into frequency and direction, the complex visual signal requires more processing. Figure 2.0 shows the mathematical/algorithmic/physical structure of a digital (discrete) Fourier transform. We need not understand its details, only its simple physical regularity. We run raw data through similar analog networks and recombine the results into maps of the world around us. The information thus gained more than compensates for the <a class="fk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_equation">time spent <span>
	The first indication of variation in the speed of mental processing came from observations of the noon transit of the sun.
</span></a> in such processing.

Flow diagram of the Sande-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), creating a pattern reminiscent of interconnections in the cortex. Each dot represents a summation, weighted by the W factor beside a <a class="fn"> path,<span>
	Cognoscenti of binary notation will notice that the labelling subscripts of the inputs and outputs are bit reversed [<i>x<sub>1  (001)</sub></i> &rarr; <i>X<sub>4 (100)</sub></i>]. This makes wiring the hardware a bit trickier than displaying the toy model.
</span></a> which is pretty much what a synapse does. In the visual system of the macaque, there are a million often bi-directional neurons (corresponding to the 8 inputs of this toy model) interconnecting some 40 ‘black-box’ processing regions. 17 additional rows and columns continuing the pattern to the left and down would accomodate 1,048,576 (2<sup>20</sup>) inputs.
</figurecaption></figure>

<p>After much such processing and reconstruction, we have remarkably good internal maps of the environment. The brain is loathe to discard hard-won information. The visual FFT data was needed to establish boundaries and edges, but what else is it good for? If evolution has left any trace of its experiments with this question, no one has sorted them out &mdash; but what it did was turn them into qualia: arbitrary sensations mapping continuous spectra into recognizably different signals. We assume (but can never know) that qualia are <a cLass="fn">common to all of us.<span>
	I know of only 2 fictional mentions of novel colors: Dr Huer&apos;s &lsquo;infra-yellow&rsquo; ray, which solidified air for Buck Rogers, and Sir Terry Pratchett&apos;s &lsquo;octarine&rsquo;, the color of magic on the Discworld. In neither case was any attempt made to describe the color.
</span></a> (The assumption is simply wrong for, e.g., deuteranopes, who lack green-sensitive retinal cones.)
</p>

<p>The hard problem may arise from this expectation that qualia are identical for all observers. This would indeed be difficult to explain. But all that evolution requires is that an environmental continuum be mappable into distinguishable qualia <i>for an individual</i>. It is useful that 475-nm blue and 555-nm green &lsquo;look different&rsquo;; it is neither useful nor necessary that my 475-nm quale be identical to your 475-nm quale &mdash; which would require either internal absolute reference points or telepathy for calibration, neither of which we know how to implement! We may assume that everyone sees the same colors, but there is no possible way to test this assumption.
</p>

<p>Perhaps the key to recognizing the arbitrary nature of qualia is the phenomenon of synesthesia, or cross-talk between sensory qualia. Some individuals experience Middle C as blue, showing just how fortuitous these mappings are (and how remarkable the working set is!). There are 60 or more known <a class="fn">types of synesthesia<span>
	EM Hubbard, VS Ramachandran (2005). &lsquo;Neurocognitive
mechanisms of synesthesia&rsquo; <cite>Neuron</cite> <b>48</b>(#3):
&ndash;520; doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2005-10-012.
</span></a> and their interaction is even less understood than the qualia themselves. In the prehistoric world, such sensory confusion was likely to have been life-shortening; today it is <a href="https://synesthesia.com/blog/types-of-synesthesia/">touted on the web</a> as a desirable and learnable experience.

Religion</h3></a>
<a class="tri" href="#04" >&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>

<p>There is a strong parallel between the work of Andrew Lang and
that of Julian Jaynes, both of whom integrated the research of
anthropologists and psychologists into useful theories of religion.</p>

<p>Lang opens <cite>The Making of Religion</cite> with a paragraph
describing what appears to be the current standard anthropological
explanation of the <a class="fn">origin of religion.<span>
A Lang (1900) <cite>The Making of Religion</cite>, 2nd ed.
(Longmans, Gtreeen, London): 1.
</span></a> Then he suggests that this approach is incomplete and
that &lsquo;the savage theory of the soul&rsquo; was based on
&lsquo;experiences which cannot be made to fit into any purely
materialistic system of the universe&rsquo; {2}. He was thinking of
&lsquo;clairvoyance, thought-transference, and telepathy&rsquo; {158},
which <i>in his day</i> were still respectable areas of research. The
hypotheses of E.B. Tylor, T.H. Huxley, A.W. Howitt, Herbert Spencer,
William James, and others now forgotten, were bubbling away in journals
and conferences. Among this ferment is a quote from Max Dessoir:</p>

<blockquote>This &lsquo;fully conscious life of the spirit&rsquo;,
in which we moderns now live, &lsquo;seems to rest upon a substratum of
<b>reflex action of a hallucinatory type</b>&rsquo; &mdash; to which
Lang adds: &lsquo;In that case &hellip; their psychical experiences
would be such as we cannot estimate, yet cannot leave, as <b>a
possibility influencing religion</b>, out of our calculations [emphasis
added]. &mdash;  Lang, <cite>Making of Religion</cite>: 57.
</blockquote>

<p>One may wonder what &lsquo;reflex action of a hallucinatory
type&rsquo; might be. <b>Guy Swanson, summarizing</b> <a
class="fn"><b>Durkheim</b>,<span>
E Durkheim (1912) <cite>The Elementary Forms of the Religious
Life, A Study in Religious Sociology</cite> Trans. JW Swain (George
Allen &amp; Unwin, no date).
</span></a> <b>described the substratum of hallucination</b> more
exactly 60 years after Lang recognized it, in a passage closely
anticipating Jaynes:</p>

<blockquote>[People] develop a concept of personified supernatural
beings directly from the model which their society provides. Unaware, as
they generally are, of the extent to which overt behavior and inner
impulse are formed by relations with other people, men find themselves
in the hands of mysterious forces. Unlike other forces, these social
customs <span style="text-decoration:underline;">seem to</span> <b>speak
to individuals, chiding them for misbehavior, directing them to choose
some goals rather than others, and rewarding their conformity</b>. The
thoroughly socialized individual has so acquired these social standards
that they are effective in directing his conduct even when he is quite
alone. &mdash; <a class="fn">Swanson, 1960.<span>
GE Swanson (1960) <cite>The Birth of the Gods: The Origin of
Primitive Beliefs</cite> (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor MI):
;
</span></a> Emphasis added.
</blockquote>

<p>Swanson concluded that these vocal &lsquo;spirits are associated
with the presence of organized decision-making [groups or]
purposes&rsquo; {179}.</p>

<p>What Lang and Swanson described was a system in which the
unconscious part of the brain successfully directed a person&apos;s
behavior into socially decreed patterns via hallucinated instructions
&mdash; a preposterous system indeed, which could not be made to fit the
modern mind because in its experience, hallucinations led quickly to
incarceration for antisocial behavior. This outré insight by
anthropologists fell unregarded from professional view.</p>

<p>Rudyard Kipling also offered a classic example of <a
class="fn">bicamerality<span>
Kipling titled his poem &lsquo;In the Neolithic Age&rsquo;, but
this is 5 or 10 thousand years too late for the Solutréan rival, and (I
claim) 23,000 years too late for the lecture by the totem. Granted,
&lsquo;Neolithic&rsquo; scans a bit better.

<p class="flu"><div style="margin-left : 70px; ">
In the Pale&apos;lithic Age, savage warfare did I wage,<br>
For food and fame and furry horse&apos;s pelt.<br>
I was singer to my clan, in the dim red dawn of man,<br>
And I sang of all we feared and fought and felt.<br>
<br>
Yea, I sang as now I sing, when the Prehistoric spring<br>
Made the piled Biscayan icepack split and shove,<br>
And troll and gnome and dwerg, and the gods of cliff and berg,<br>
Were about me and beneath me and above.<br>
<br>
Then a rival from Solutr&eacute; told the tribe my style was
outr&eacute;;<br>
Neath a tomahawk, of diorite, he fell.<br>
And I left my views on art, barbed and tanged beneath the
heart,<br>
Of a mammothistic etcher in Grenelle.<br>
<br>
Then I split them, scalp from skull, and my hunting dogs fed
full,<br>
And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong.<br>
And I wiped my mouth and said, it is well that they are dead,<br>
For I knew my work was right and theirs was wrong.<br>
<br>
But my totem saw the shame, from his ridgepole shrine he came,<br>
And he told me in a vision of the night:<br>
&lsquo;There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays
&mdash; <br>
And every single one of them is right.&rsquo;<br>
<br></div></p>


<p>The &lsquo;ridgepole&rsquo; is perhaps an intrusion from
Margaret Mead&apos;s Melanesia, but the dream is exactly the bicameral,
<a class="gl" href="../../evoligion/_G/Glo.shtml#vic">vicarial</a>
type <a href="#19">described by Jaynes</a>. The behavior of the
singer is straight Middle Paleolithic Instinct-1. The attitude of the
totem is not yet conscience, it is the social conditioning of the tribe
that kept the peace in the Upper Paleolithic.</p>

<p>It was left to Jaynes to rediscover and elucidate the process,
this time by analysis of schizophrenic patients, and texts and artwork
from the dawn of writing, whose dominant theme was &lsquo;my god has
abandoned me&rsquo;. Viewed in the light of ethnology, his work is not
the wild and unfounded science fiction seen by his perplexed peers, but
the next step in the gradual demystification of a complex and forgotten
process. In essence, all that Jaynes did was remove the &lsquo;seem
to&rsquo; (underlined above) which Swanson had had to place before
&lsquo;speak to individuals&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="epi">[M]ost of [people&apos;s] everyday life is
determined not by their conscious intentions and deliberate choices but
by mental processes that are put into motion by features of the
environment and that operate outside of conscious awareness and
guidance. &mdash;  <a class="fn">Bargh and Chartrand (1999).<span>

</span></a>
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Few problems have endured longer or traversed a more
perplexing history than the problem of consciousness and its place in
nature.&rsquo; So Jaynes introduced a 145-page discussion of the meaning
of &lsquo;consciousness&rsquo;. He begins by showing that consciousness
&mdash; <b>the process and content of introspection</b> &mdash; is not
any of the things we o ?
</p>

<blockquote>[C]onsciousness is not all mentality, not necessary for
sensation or perception, &hellip; it is not a copy of experience, nor
necessary for learning, nor even necessary for thinking and reasoning,
and has only an arbitrary and functional location. As a prelude to what
I am to say later, I wish you to consider that there could have been at
one time human beings who did most of the things we do &mdash; speak,
understand, perceive, solve problems &mdash; but who were without
consciousness. &mdash; Jaynes &lsquo;Consciousness and the Voices of the Mind&rsquo; <cite>Canadian Psychology</cite> <b>27</b> (#2)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>[E]verybody from Darwin on, including myself in earlier
years, was wrong in trying to trace out the origin of consciousness
biologically or neurophysiologically. [&hellip; W]e have to look at
human history after language has evolved and ask when in history did an
analog &lsquo;I&rsquo; narratizing in a mind-space begin. &mdash; <a
class="fn">Jaynes (1986).<span>
J Jaynes (1986) &lsquo;Consciousness and the Voices of the
Mind&rsquo; <cite>Canadian Psychology</cite> <b>27</b>(#2)
&ndash;148.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The &lsquo;analog <q>I</q> narratizing in a mind space&rsquo;
describes what we do when we introspect. The lack of evolutionary
predecessors means that consciousness is an emergent property,
unpredictable in advance, and resulting from complexity,<i> including
language</i>.
</p>

<p>Jaynes&apos;s discussion of &lsquo;what consciousness is
<i>not</i>&rsquo; is prolog to 315 pages in which he holds that we did
not attain consciousness until the dawn of history, roughly 1200 BCE.
&lsquo;It is as if all life evolved to a certain point, and then in
ourselves turned a right angle and simply exploded in another
direction.&rsquo; Jaynes denoted the predecessor of consciousness
&lsquo;bicamerality&rsquo;, describing a &lsquo;2-room&rsquo; brain. The
rooms were perhaps the paired temporal lobes of the brain, for as we
saw in <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#T1.4">Chapter 1</a>, the brain does not
waste space by duplicating functions. The rooms were occupied by an
agent on one side (the left, with whom we identify), and a
decision-making executive on the other &mdash; neither of whom could
think about his mental processes. One-way communication, from executive
to agent, was verbal (aural hallucination), perhaps transmitted over the
anterior commissure.
</p>

<p id="04a">This is the enormous step that Jaynes&apos;s peers were
reluctant to follow. To pursue evidence for a major change in the
behavior of the brain (of the sort anticipated by Hegel), on the basis
of an idiosyncratic analysis of a few almost prehistoric artefacts and
texts, seemed an unlikely way to advance one&apos;s career. As a result,
Jaynes&apos;s work remains under-appreciated. Still, all that he said
was that some of the things that distinguish us from the other great
apes happened so recently that we can study them with the tools of art
history and psychology. If one reduces the bicameral conjecture to its
component hypotheses one gets research projects that granting agencies
can understand:

<p>What is different about the daily life of an unconscious person?
Oliver Sacks describes Joseph, who was thought to be retarded until he
was 11, when someone realized that he was merely deaf. A year of
learning sign language gave him rudimentary communication &mdash; but
with odd results, for Joseph lacked the ability to introspect, to create
an analog &lsquo;I&rsquo; with the ability to explore a rich mind-space
filled with memories coded in language, in which non-immediate options
could be explored:
</p>

<blockquote>Joseph &hellip; had no problem with perceptual
categorization or generalization, but he could not &hellip; hold
abstract ideas in mind, reflect, play, plan. He seemed completely
literal &mdash; unable to juggle images or hypotheses or possibilities,
unable to enter an imaginative or figurative realm. &hellip; He seemed
like an animal, or an infant, to be stuck in the present, to be confined
to literal and immediate perception. &mdash; <a class="fn">Sacks
(1989).<span>
O Sacks (1989) <cite>Seeing Voices</cite> (HarperPerennial, NY,
): 40, 45.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be that Joseph&apos;s condition is not so much
pathological, as one end of a continuum. I suggest this because the
immediate visual image brought to mind by this passage is Grant
Wood&apos;s <cite>American Gothic</cite>, which <a

</p>

<p>Joseph&apos;s plight raises the issue of the relation of
language to mental development. What is the role of vocabulary? How does
the &lsquo;imaginative and figurative realm&rsquo; of adults differ as a
function of their early vocabularies? Are the &lsquo;See Spot run&rsquo;
books and the many schools that
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"

do not expect 4th-graders to spell &lsquo;cat&rsquo; and

<p class="epi"> All past and present claims to the contrary,
science cannot yet resolve the question of animal consciousness. For
over a century, scientists believed that evolutionary theory required at
least some traces of consciousness in animals. Empirical studies (e.g.,
on insight, language acquisition, mirror self-recognition, and
deception) lent further support to this viewpoint. In retrospect,
however, neither theory nor experiments proved decisive. &mdash; <a

</p>

<blockquote>The gods were in no sense &lsquo;figments of the

occupied his nervous system, probably his right hemisphere, and from
stores of admonitory and preceptive experience, transmuted this

<p>The support for Jaynes&apos;s &lsquo;committee of 2&rsquo; is as

approaches are not mutually exclusive. Freud&apos;s division, following
Plato&apos;s tripartite soul &mdash; appetitive, rational, and spiritual
&mdash; parallels the layering of the brain. Bicamerality parallels the
division of the brain into hemispheres. The hemispheres are complex

<p>A hallucinated dialog is more efficient than an internal debate.
Instead of asking oneself, &lsquo;What will Mom say if I ask her

practiced Internal Mom, &lsquo;Mom, may I do thus-and-so?&rsquo;, and
Internal Mom answers. Neural plasticity means that the brains of
children in different environments develop differently. In a bicameral
world invisible playmates became civic advisors. In our world,
&lsquo;Internal Mom&rsquo; becomes our conscience. Same function,
different neurological details (synapses). Those with active consciences
may find them annoying, but seldom need to account for them.
Bicamerality is a different form of conscience, and needs no other

kills Hamlet&apos;s father, who then appears to Hamlet as a ghost and
demands vengeance. In the manner of Greek tragedies, all of the
principals die in the last act &mdash; but Hamlet does succeed in
avenging his father. And yet even while Hamlet is experiencing classical
bicameral hallucinations, he is also the first introspective dramatic
hero. As for Socrates 2 millennia earlier, his brain finds uses for both

<a class="tri" href="#11"  >&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>


<p>Before Enlightenment scientists sorted out the circulation of
the blood and the chemistry of oxidation, there was understandable
confusion about the function of breathing. This confusion is epitomized
by the Greek word <i>pneuma</i>, which originally meant &lsquo;blast,
wind&rsquo;. Later it was softened to &lsquo;air, breeze&rsquo;, then
with metaphorical qualifiers, &lsquo;air imagined as filling the
veins&rsquo;, and &lsquo;breath of life&rsquo;. In bicameral days,
deceased relatives commonly spoke to their surviving family &mdash; but
the shades of animals apparently <a class="fn">did not.<span>
The speaking animals of folklore indicate that they were at
least heard by anyone able to interpret the nonverbal communication of
living animals.
</span></a> Those to whom departed animals never said a word
naturally assumed that people possessed something unique, unknown to
animals. The <a href="../_B/B07.shtml#01">egocentricity of the religious
personality</a>, demanding that there be some exalted difference between
us and them, seized upon this as the essential difference. Respiration
&mdash; which had been the practical distinction between an unconscious
body and a dead one in the <cite>Iliad &mdash; </cite>was transmogrified
by mystified poets into a vehicle for the bicameral voice of the
departed. By the time of the New Testament, <i>pneuma</i> was used with
the connotation we today attach to &lsquo;soul&rsquo;. As <a
class="fn">Tylor<span>
	EB Tylor (1871) <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>, 2 vols, 4th ed.
(John Murray, London, 1903): I, 432.
</span></a> shows, this interpretation was common throughout the
primitive world. The spirit of man departs with the last breath: taken
at face value, this indicates that it enters with the first one &mdash;
a detail of possible interest in the abortion debate.
</p>

<p>Indeed, <a class="fn">this understanding<span>
J Vinycomb (1906) <cite>Fictitious &amp; Symbolic Creatures in
Art</cite> (Chapman and Hall, London): 53.
</span></a> is reinforced by the Christian symbology of the winged
lion of St Mark: &lsquo;The lion was accepted in early times as a symbol
of the resurrection because the young lion was believed always to be
born dead, but was awakened to vitality by the breath &hellip; of its
sire.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Logically, this usage removes the essential characteristic of
humanity from the fetus. It is <i>potentially</i> human until it takes
its first breath. For 200,000 years, the interval between delivery and
first inhalation gave midwives an opportunity for a final error check
before accepting a new candidate for tribal membership. Obviously
deformed neonates never took their first breath: Better a wasted
pregnancy than a wasted life. Mercantilism and its demand for an ever
increasing market led us into the trap of regarding the fetus as a
potential customer, to be preserved at whatever cost &mdash; to the
mother.

<p class="epi">We cannot help viewing Socrates as the
turning-point, the vortex of world history. &mdash; <a class="fn">
Nietzsche (1872) <span><cite>The Birth of Tragedy</cite>  11tr.
F Golffing (Doubleday Anchor, NYC, 1974): 94.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Nietzsche seems to have understood that
Socrates stood on the cusp of the
bicameral/introspective transition,
	<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"
src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="NewIdea road sign"></a>
for he wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>In this totally anomalous character, instinctive wisdom
reveals itself only in order to stand up now and then against conscious
knowledge as a hindrance. Whereas in all productive men instinct is the
truly creative and affirming power, and consciousness acts as a critical
and cautioning reaction, in Socrates instinct becomes the critic,
consciousness becomes the creator &mdash; truly a monstrosity <i>per
defectum</i> [from some defect]! &mdash;  F Nietzsche (1872) <cite>The
Birth of Tragedy</cite> §13.
</blockquote>

<p>One can question Nietzsche&apos;s identification of instinct as
the source of creativity, because instinct, strictly speaking, is
retrospective, conservative, and the epitome of what kept our ancestors
alive. Nietzsche seems to use it here to mean what he would later call
the unconscious, of which instinct is but a part. He also misconstrued
the nature of Socrates&apos;s <i>daemon</i>, for it was not instinct but
the accumulated wisdom of the bicameral mind.
</p>

<p>Despite his confusions, Nietzsche captured the essence of
Socrates, and what it was that
made him the Classical &lsquo;<a class="fn">vortex&rsquo;.<span>
Or Western vortex. In a wider view, Isaiah, Zoroasters,
Gautama, and Confucius were the vortices of their cultures.
</span></a> I will maintain <a href="../_D/D14.shtml#D14">below</a>
that the Axial Age (of which Socrates was a primary manifestation) was
the the first impressive result of the process that Jaynes called
&lsquo;the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral
mind&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Socrates heard a &lsquo;warning voice&rsquo; in childhood (ek
paidos arxamenon, <cite>Apology</cite> 31d), and as an adult his
&lsquo;spiritual sign visits [him] now and then&rsquo;
(<cite>Euthyphro</cite> 3b); this might seem an opaque reference, but it
is clarified later, for in <cite>Phaedrus</cite> 242bc we find that he
never had to think about ethics. Whenever the possibility of unethical
action arose, his personal daemon intervened and told him not to do it.
Aristotle interpreted that statement figuratively, but I think Socrates
meant exactly what he said: He did not &lsquo;hear&rsquo; the still
small voice of conscience, he <i>heard</i> an internal Attic Greek voice
saying &lsquo;<a class="fn"><i>STOP!&rsquo;</i>.<span>
This is an idiosyncratic interpretation, for other members of
the Julian Jaynes Society side with Aristotle.
</span></a> On the other hand, the &lsquo;Socratic method&rsquo; of
asking leading questions until the answerer argues himself into a truth
can also be interpreted as questions by a sharp, conscious, analytical
mind that was also vestigially bicameral. Realizing his own difference
from others, Socrates may have been genuinely interested in how other
people worked their way to ethical judgements. I think Jaynes and
Socrates would have had a great deal to talk about!
</p>

<p>Bicamerality persisted for half a millennium afer Socrates, as
we know from the Syrian Mara Bar Serapion. Writing to his son from
prison some time between 73 and 256 CE, and urging him to follow wise
men of the past (mentioning Socrates, Pythagoras, and Jesus), he <a
class="fn">observed,<span>
&lsquo;A Letter of Mara, Son of Serapion&rsquo; (transl. BP
Pratten) in <cite>Ante-Nicene Fathers Vol. VIII, Memoirs of Edessa And
Other Ancient Syriac Documents</cite>: 735. (Note that &lsquo;lived on
in&rsquo; is apparently a translator&apos;s explanatory insertion, as it
does not appear in Pratten&apos;s version, but is imported from
Habermas, G (1996) <cite>The Historical Jesus</cite> (College Press
Publishing Company, Joplin MO).)
</span></a> &lsquo;But Socrates did not die for good; he lived on
in the <a href="#15">statue</a> of Hera.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Socrates saw that &lsquo;the unexamined life is not worth
living&rsquo;. He still heard a bicameral voice, yet he could introspect
and examine his life, and it seems that he noticed that many did not,
and that this led to a wasted life. Many <i>still</i> do not, so
conscious introspection is not automatic after bicamerality is lost.
Apollo&apos;s &lsquo;Know thyself&rsquo; was the most important advice
that could be offered at the dawn of consciousness. Or later.
</p>

<p>Socrates&apos;s daemon is for me a convincing verification of
Jaynes&apos;s bicameral conjecture, but he was not alone. Isaiah heard
the voice of YHVH. The hymns of the orally transmitted Vedas are the
special sort of knowledge (<i>vid</i>) that is heard (<i>sruti</i>), and
they differ from the Gathas of Iran only in dialect. This suggests that
Zoroaster was bicameral: certainly he knew the concept of
&lsquo;messenger of god&rsquo;. Confucius &mdash; otherwise a
&lsquo;benevolent agnostic&rsquo; knew of <a class="fn">statues which
spoke<span>
HA Giles (1905) <cite>Religions of Ancient China</cite>
(Norwood Editions, Norwood PA, 1977); Ch 2.
</span></a> in times of stress, and perhaps was remembering a
bicameral age when he said of spirits, &lsquo;We <i>listen for them</i>
but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is
nothing without them&rsquo;. Nothing I have read suggests that Gautama
was bicameral.

<p>How did consciousness replace bicamerality? This question is as
important as the idea of bicamerality itself, because it represents a
dramatic change in mental behavior which no one before Jaynes had seen
in the historical record. Nor is there any obvious reason for such a
change to occur.
</p>

<p>Perhaps part of the problem is that defining consciousness as
&lsquo;that which is <i>introspect<b>able</b></i>&rsquo; seems too
broad, and I would replace it with &lsquo;that which is
<i>introspect<b>ed</b></i>&rsquo;. Possession of an ability does not
guarantee its use, and those who fail to examine their own motivations
no more understand themselves than do sheep. Only those things which we
mull over are truly our own. This definition also emphasizes
consciousness as a graded property which cannot be acquired suddenly; it
is, in short, <i>learned</i> behavior, and learning takes time, both
personal and historical.
</p>

<p>Consider the unrelated psychological behavior of denial. We are
all still prone to this protective device, despite the problem that
follow in its wake. An anguished primal scream &lsquo;No-o-o!&rsquo; at
the loss of a loved one may mean either &lsquo;This isn&apos;t
happening!&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I didn&apos;t want that to happen!&rsquo;.
The first is denial, and if persisted in, problematic. The second is
realistic grief, and curative. To the uninvolved onlooker, the internal
significance is undetectable, and prior to Freud there was no way to
analyze the difference. Sophocles was aware of denial&apos;s
consequences, but he did not baptise it with a common noun to make it
public property. So too with bicamerality. When observers do not
understand it, they do not see it from outside, and its effects get
lumped into the &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; we attribute to small-scale
societies. No anthropological research prior to Jaynes&apos;s 1976 book
was aware that it should investigate bicamerality.

<p>Bicamerality faded out in different regions at different times,
never recognized for what it was. The fading
was neither simultaneous across a society, nor complete. Perhaps
there were both genetic and cultural components to the process, as
suggested in Table 2.1, so that the details differed in different
places. As bicamerality weakened, internal voices simply went quiet.
Jaynes cites much literary and artistic evidence for this phase, of
which Fig. 2.2 is a sample.

<p>Jaynes pointed out that words having physical referents in the

<p class="flu">Between the 2 usages lies development of
introspection and thus the conscious mind. Exactly the same sort of

<p>We can, perhaps, see the beginning of the end in Hesiod, where
his Muses say to him,

</blockquote>

<p>It is unfortunate that the voices who spoke to other bicameral
prophets did not begin in this manner, for we know today that the first
line is an accurate description of contemporary bicameral messaging
(among schizophrenics, for instance). It may be that this is
characteristic of the last stages of bicamerality, when it no longer
makes all important decisions, and the urges of the individual
subconscious begin to replace the collective rules of the community.
This same weakening also freed the cortex from bicameral control and
allowed the invention of philosophy in Miletus.

	Cited by T Freeth, A Jones (2012) &lsquo;The Cosmos in the

</span></a> is that 4 or 5 centuries after the Antikythera
mechanism, related devices were still being designed bicamerally. An
Egyptian papyrus describes an &lsquo;<a class="fn">astrologer&apos;s
board&rsquo;<span>

<p>These are the colors used in the working reconstructions of the
Antikythera mechanism (for which no such indicators were recovered). But
what &lsquo;in accordance with their nature&rsquo; means is
anybody&apos;s guess. It is likely that this was a static display, and
that the precise ratios of astronomical theory that characterize the
Antikythera machine are the province of the conscious mind, and that the
Greeks were precocious in his respect.

resulted from the dust veil produced by a cometary strike in Malaysia. A
missing piece of the Enke cometary entourage seems a likely culprit.
Half a dozen Malaysian cultures vanished at that time. Then, as now,

<i>Jubaea</i> palm pollen disappears from lake sediments. The palm was a
staple food, providing 50 kg of edible nuts annually &mdash; or an
instant 400 liters of palm wine. The model implies intertribal
disharmony and competition for resources (and we know about warfare and
cannibalism). Since contemporary Rapanui show no inclination to protect
scarce resources, one wonders if the last palm, belonging to tribe A,
was cut down by tribe B looking for a final glorious party. No palms
meant no more sea-going canoes or fishing (extratropical Rapa Nui has
neither reef or lagoon). The islanders next ate the birds, after which
the population declined to 2000&ndash;3000 by the time the Dutch arrived
in 1712. When the Spaniards showed up in 1770, most of the moai had been
overthrown, probably to deprive enemy tribes of their advice.

the moai did these things. The recent discovery of a white shell insert
showed that they had removable eyes, suggesting a similarity to

<p>None of the above reasons for the loss of bicamerality seems
applicable to New Guinea. Some feel that fragility alone is sufficient
to end bicamerality when there is an alternative social model. In New
Guinea as in Meso-America, Westerners did not suspect the existence of
bicamerality, and did not report it. No one asked the right questions;
lacking a common language, the symptoms of bicamerality disappear into
the mists of misunderstanding. When a bicameral culture is suddenly
exposed to fully conscious people the voices are nonplussed because the
only advice they have to offer is suddenly irrelevant tradition.

<p>Jaynes did not mention sub-Saharan Africa in connection with
bicamerality. The African world was rife with animist spirits, mostly
inimical, and benevolent spirits of any sort are rare. &lsquo;The

<h5><a href="#id.Bk"> Arabia </a></h5>
<a class="tri" href="#21">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>

<p>At this point, Arabia seems to be something of an anomaly. We
know that Arabians still heard voices in the late first milliennium CE,
centuries after they had gone quiet in nearby Mesopotamia. <a
class="fn">Ibn Al-Kalbi<span>
H Ibn Al-Kalbi (c 800) <cite>The Book of Idols</cite> Being a
Translation from the Arabic of the <cite>Kitab Al-Asnam</cite> tr. NA

</span></a> (d. 821 CE/206 AH) tells us that &lsquo;Over [the rock
idol Al-Uzza] Zalim built a house called Buss in which the people used
to receive oracular communications.&rsquo; (Muhamad later recognized
Al-Uzza as a competitor to Allah and expelled her from the Ka&apos;aba.)
</p>

<p>However, <i>personal</i> voices in Arabia seem to have been
destructive, and certainly were not known for providing the socially
useful direction attributed to bicameral voices. Perhaps this was a
product of the <a href="../_D/D13.shtml#12">Reichian armoring</a> that
accompanies desertification; perhaps the mores and social rules of
tribal nomads lay closer to the wishes of the id.
</p>

<p>Scattered Quranic verses suggest that everyone has an invisible
companion, generally regarded as evil:

<p class="flu">There are also aspects of Islamic culture that do
not object to constant supervision by a nanny:
</p>

<ul class="udisc">
<li>Islam tries (in Shari&apos;a) to provide rules for every aspect
of behavior, so that one knows at all times what Allah wants him to do.
This feels like an attempt to provide the certainty of bicameral days
after the voices go silent.
</li>

<li>Islamic schooling seems designed to retain bicameral control of
the faithful. An example of the need for this is a current Islamic web
page describing the danger of critical analysis of the Qurʾan:
&lsquo;Muslims will no longer be able to claim to know what the <a

<p>It is hard to avoid the suspicion that in this case, the
right-hemisphere (vocal or mute) adopted as its cultural rule
&lsquo;What would Muhamad do?&rsquo; as set out in Quran, Shari&apos;a,
and hadith. At the same time, it seems to have gotten itself a
reputation for being evil, but given the enthusiasm with which Muslims
have historically killed other Muslims, these are not discordant
results. One wonders:
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"

Are there other cultures in which the bicameral &lsquo;civic advisor&rsquo; developed antisocial behavior, as it does for schizophrenic individuals?

<p>Several other contemporary phenomena are best explained by the
bicameral conjecture. Spiritualist mediums who hear voices and truly
believe that they &lsquo;contact the spirit world&rsquo; are obvious
candidates, but 150 years of
increasingly critical study (in the sense of clever design,
double-blinded experiments in which neither parsicpant for experimenter
knows the expeted result, and  statistical analysis), have suggested no
promising avenues of research. We look at less emotionally loaded
examples.

<h5><a href="#id.Bk"> Hypnotism </a></h5>
<a class="tri" href="#24">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>


<p>A Dublin psychiatrist who did stage shows for fun (and
advertizing) explained that the difference between entertainment and
healing lay in the suggestions offered by the hypnotist. Calling for
volunteers, he sent half back to their seats, assessing susceptibility
at a glance. The remainder were putty in his hands. When he told them
they itched, they scratched. Some were so tormented that they started
after the troubling spots by disrobing on stage. He told them to freeze;
they stood immobile in awkward poses until he gave them new
instructions. He told them they were happy; they laughed. He told them
they were sad; they cried.
</p>

<p>Next he gave them a short rest, in which they could do anything
they wished, and then asked them about their activities. One young chap
was with his girl and indignant at the interruption, so the hypnotist
left him to get on with it. Another, more imaginative, was &lsquo;skiing
the prominences of the sun&rsquo;, and it was the most thrilling
experience of his life.
</p>

<p>The finale was a posthypnotic command. As the audience filed
out, each of his subjects would spot a leprechaun, pursue him, capture
him, and take him home. And so they did. In a most undignified
performance, well-dressed middle-aged ladies leaped off the stage,
clambered over seats, and pushed people aside as they pursued elusive
little men whom only they could see. One fellow held an empty armful as
though he were restraining a thrashing 4-year-old, asking me,
&lsquo;Isn&apos;t he cute?&rsquo;. Cab drivers watched bemused as
customers stuffed uncooperative leprechauns into their vehicles. One
driver, inured to the effects of Guinness, locked his front door,
insisting, &lsquo;Both of ye, get in the back.&rsquo; The amount of
brain processing needed to produce these leprechauns comes perilously
close to the strong hallucinations &mdash; &lsquo;3D, &hellip;
resist[ing] with a sense of solidity, &amp;c&rsquo; &mdash; that <a

Juan</cite>.<span>
For the record, I too felt strongly that Castañeda was not a
trustworthy guide, so I stopped reading him after his second book.
Others, less sceptical, insist that he becomes more reliable in later
volumes.
</span></a> I seldom disagree with Dennett, but these post-hynotic
subjects were physically struggling with their hallucinations on the
streets of Dublin.

Edoardo Casiglio<span> (2008) &lsquo;Hypnosis in the Theory of
the Bicameral Mind&rsquo; <cite>The Jaynesian,</cite> Sping 2008:
&ndash;14.
</span></a> of the University of Padua, explains why hypnosis is so
easily induced:
</p>

<blockquote>Consciousness &hellip; is also accompanied by
epiphenomena that are not always welcome, such as the awareness of the
imminence of death, the passing of time, guilt, regret: in short, the
loss of Eden. This loss is so recent &hellip; that it takes very little
to &lsquo;forget&rsquo; the real state of the emancipated humans and go
back temporarily to the latent bicameral condition.
</blockquote>

<p>In bicameral days, the instructions of the internal adviser were
as compelling as those of the today&apos;s hypnotist. Because
&lsquo;such individuals had no mind-space in which to question or rebel,
such voices had to be obeyed&rsquo;, says Jaynes. As long as the
&lsquo;voices&rsquo; &mdash; the gods of society &mdash; agreed on
behavior, society worked as smoothly as an ant hill, with people
uncomplainingly building ziggurats as instructed by their gods. The
pyramids did not require coercion.

<a class="tri" href="#25">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>


<p><i>Schizophrenia</i> means &lsquo;split mind&rsquo;, and its
voices arise when the right hemisphere acts as the speech center for the
unconscious, or for the alternate personality in the right temporal
lobe. The caliber of the communication depends upon the quality of the
unconscious. Since only disturbed patients get to the clinic, selection
bias is at work, so that the clinical assumption is that schizophrenia
is always dysfunctional. <a class="fn">Factor analysis<span>

(Penguin, Harmondsworth).
</span></a> &mdash; mysterious, perhaps, but <i>normally</i> so.
Only when the instructions are socially disruptive are those who obey
them noticed &mdash; and generally incarcerated in mental hospitals as a
result. Yet not all internal voices are disruptive, and internet
searches turn up a wide range of &lsquo;spirit guides&rsquo;
indistinguishable from schizophrenic voices.

<h5><a href="#id.Bk"> Oracular Statues </a></h5>
<a class="tri" href="#26">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>


<p>Sometimes &lsquo;the voices&rsquo; have clear external
locations. A classical example is the speaking statue. In Linear B (the
earliest readable Greek) the ruler is a <i>wanax</i>. His chief steward
is a <i>basileus</i>, or &lsquo;king&rsquo;. Evidence from other
cultures suggests that the <i>wanax</i> was not a person, but a statue
who instructed the king. &lsquo;Statue <i>who</i>&rsquo; because it was
perceived as, and gave orders in the manner of, a god. If one hears an
&lsquo;external&rsquo; voice, and is troubled because there is no one to
produce it, the voice issues instructions to make a statue for it.
</p>

<p>The bicameral mind may hear more than one voice. The Internal
Playmate becomes a personal daemon with advice on personal behavior. The
rules of your trade are heard as its tutelary deity. Laws are heard in
the voice of the king, and outlive the king himself: <i>The dead king
becomes a living god</i>. His voice is still heard, so his body is
preserved, with a historical progression in which body parts of the king
are steadily decreased: first he is mummified, later his skull is built
into a statue, finally he is replaced by a statue. Late statues equipped
with speaking tubes were not deliberate fraud, but a desperate attempt
to continue hearing traditional advice as the voices went silent.
</p>

<p>Bicameral cultures tell us that people <i>really</i> die long
after their apparent death. For the lifetimes of their grandchildren,
their hallucinated voices may still be heard. It follows that during
this period, the &lsquo;dead&rsquo; need all the paraphernalia of grave
goods.
</p>

<p>The Bible describes YHVH speaking from a fire {Deut 4:12}, so
none of this should seem strange to Jews or Christians. On his way to
punish the Israelites for their sins, &lsquo;The king of Babylon, he
consulted with images&rsquo; {Ezekiel 21:21}.
</p>

<p id="15a">Hammurabi heard the voice of Shamash, god of justice,
and what he heard was good enough to influence our own law code. His
letters to viceroys (all in his own handwriting) began with an
instruction <i>to the letter</i>, &lsquo;Say unto So-and-so
&hellip;&rsquo;, as though the letter were not read but heard. In
Catholic girls&rsquo; schools, statues of the Virgin still verbally
soothe adolescent turmoil. The figures on Achilles&apos;s shield
conversed like living mortals {Iliad 18.539}. The speech of
<b>herms</b>, postlike statues with a human head and priapic genitals,
is well attested in Greek literature. One of <a

<p>For many people, &lsquo;voices&rsquo; are a useful resource.
Among my acquaintances are college-educated professionals who assure me
that they have &lsquo;guardian angels&rsquo; or &lsquo;invisible
gurus&rsquo; who offer consistently good advice. They seldom talk about
them, because people look at them oddly when they do.
</p>

<p>From examples offered, a sceptic notes that the information
spans a range of genres. At one end, anthropologists would class it with
descriptions of the shamans&rsquo; spirit world. It slips imperceptibly
into behavior modification with philosophic generalities and advice on
diet, social relations, purchases, and health care. The advice is valid
&mdash; but characteristically something which the person might have
noticed subconsciously. Night-driving fatigue induces the guardian angel
to suggest, &lsquo;Turn around. There&apos;s a motel on the left a
couple of miles back.&rsquo; The suggestion is never,
&lsquo;There&apos;s a motel a half-mile ahead&rsquo;.

Twice, a dream image persisted through the hypnopompic state
until I was fully awake. Once it occupied the center of the visual field
as though sitting between me and the foot of the bed. I tried to
preserve it for study, succeeding for not more than 5 seconds, before it
winked out and the foot of the bed continued across the space the image
had occupied. Brief as it was, it gives a clear indication that the
dream mechanism &mdash; which can call on memory, the subconscious, the
audio-vocal system, and the sensory-motor system &mdash; projects its
images along the same path used by the retina, and in the same manner. I
have not found a better description of this process in the literature.
The second time, I watched a water strider (Gerrid) take off and fly
&mdash; something I have never seen in real life. It flew slowly, and I
woke up to observe better (an attempt that clearly implies a lack of
coordination between cortex and limbos during sleep!). It kept flying as
the background slowly dissolved from small stream to bedclothes, and
finally faded out.

in half of them. Unfortunately, the paper is behind a paywall (it&apos;s
a medical journal), and the abstract does not say what fraction of the
episodes included helpful advice. At least one of the co-authors was a
mountaineer who had hallucinated deceptive mountain guides when he was
in trouble on Dhaulagiri (Nepal, 8167 m): ‘Jump here. you’ll be out of
danger in no time’, offering a 1000-foot precipice. Cautious, he tried a
short jump, which hurt sufficiently to dissuade him from the long one.

earlier work by Marius Romme and Sandra Escher in the Netherlands. It is
an organization for voice hearers and others interested in this
phenomenon whose attitude is that auditory hallucination is not a
pathological phenomenon in need of eradication but a meaningful, useful
experience. Many of its members started hearing voices after a traumatic
stress, just as in bicameral days. Oddly, the movement mentions
Jaynes&apos;s work only in passing, as one &lsquo;frame of
reference&rsquo; among many (&lsquo;psychodynamic, mystical,
parapsychological, and medical&rsquo;) adopted by a particular

<p>Hypnotism and schizophrenia may be remnants of the non-conscious
bicameral state, but they are transient or pathological, and oracular
statues are rare nowadays. However, persistent forms of bicamerality are
still with us, and either harmless or downright useful.

<p>Today our dreams are <i><b>vicarial</b></i> (the analog
&lsquo;I&rsquo; is doing something besides sleeping) and
<i>translocative</i> (the action is somewhere other than where one is
sleeping). In bicameral days this was apparently not the case. The
dreams in the <cite>Iliad</cite> and Genesis are of a god standing by
the bed issuing instructions. Dreams recorded in cuneiform tablets go
back to 2500 BCE and are all of this type. <a class="fn">Jaynes<span>
J Jaynes (1986) &lsquo;Consciousness And The Voices Of The
Mind&rsquo; <cite>Canadian Psychology</cite> <b>27</b>(#2)
&ndash;148.

</p>

<blockquote>historical change in the nature of dreams, as one of
the great confirmations of the strong form of the central hypothesis of
the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind.

<p>If I sleep long enough to finish all of the brain&apos;s
&lsquo;chron&rsquo; jobs (the computer maintenance program run by Unix
systems every morning at 03:00), somebody lets the brain-kittens loose,
and I wake myself laughing at the dreams they turn out. What a dull life
bicamerality must have imposed!</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you have conversations in your dreams, your
brain is obviously capable of generating internal speech without
conscious help. The difference from bicameral advice is twofold:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Dreams, these days, do not habitually offer good advice and
often seem totally random.</li>
<li>Speech generation by the right hemisphere is normally shut down
<i>except</i> during sleep.</li>

</p>

<p>What I find more puzzling is neglect of the bicameral hypothesis
in studies of the &lsquo;Evolution of Religion&rsquo;. The project of
this name supported by The John Templeton Foundation, specifically
includes &lsquo;theoretical analyses on the function, cognition,
development, and phylogeny of religion&rsquo;. Yet in scanning some <a

<p>The common Islamic name <i>Abdullah</i> means
&lsquo;slave of Allah&rsquo; &mdash; an exact description of
bicamerality. <i>Islam</i> is generally translated as
&lsquo;submission&rsquo;, which again is a bicameral urge. Does this
suggest that the psychological need at the root of Islam&apos;s
popularity, and its millennial attention to ever more detailed
refinement of Shari&apos;a, is a sibling of the Freudian
back-to-the-womb urge? (See <a
href="http://jezebel.com/5917949/climb-back-into-the-womb-with-this-
handy-uterus-chair">here</a> for a commercial application of this urge.)
Since few Muslims can read Quranic Arabic, Islam is largely an oral
religion, and what one hears depends on whom one listens to. This is the
primary reason for conflicting description of Islam-3 (which one hears
from apologists) as a religion of peace, and Islam-1 (which one reads
about in the Quran, history books and newspapers) as a religion of <a
class="fn">brutal conquest.<span>
The rationale for the numbered Islams will become clear in Ch.
.
</span></a> Whatever individual Muslims may feel, Islam preaches
bicamerality, and it seems to have developed methods for teaching that
encourage the development bicamerality.

<p>A <a class="fn"><cite>Guardian</cite> columnist<span>
C Brooks (2006) &lsquo;Get on the right track&rsquo;.
<cite>Guardian Weekly</cite> 2006-09-15 p16.
</span></a> writes that non-English-speaking cab drivers who do not
know London expect fares to type their destination into the GPS, after
which it tells the driver when to turn. Said he,
</p>

<blockquote>It occurred to me that I'd quite like a GPS of my own
for simple real-life instructions on what to do next. It'd cover all the
basics &hellip; just like an electronic organizer except it would be
plugged directly into your brain.&hellip;
<br>

<br>OK, so you'd be little more than an obedient puppet, wandering
through life with no free will &mdash; but by God, it'd be simpler.
</blockquote>

<p>This exactly describes our earlier operating system. Even the
expletive &lsquo;by God&rsquo; is spot on. This is the way the gods ran
our lives &mdash; and simplicity was the reason. Thinking is hard work:
why do your own if it has already been done for you? Possessing a
complex organ does not mean that we know how to use it, so perhaps
bicamerality was a needed half-way stage between the animal unconscious
and what we have today. Perhaps a better operating system lies ahead.

envied by every politician, it is imperative that we learn to understand

<p class="epi">Faith includes a <i>sacrificium intellectus</i>
[sacrifice of the intellect] (provided that there is an intellect to
sacrifice). &mdash; Jung
</p>

<p>As bicamerality died, people ceased to experience gods, leaving
the emptiness of Fig. 2.2. This is analogous to the disappearance of an
established fishery, with 2 possible responses. One can conclude that
the fish have moved away, or that we have eaten them. One can conclude
that the gods have departed, or that they were figments of our
imagination. No prize for guessing which answers we preferred.
</p>

<p>Philosophers should rejoice at the loss of bicamerality, as it
enables us to move forward into a conscious exploration of our universe.
This has not been the usual response. More typical is an ersatz
bicamerality:
</p>

<blockquote>When people cease to experience God, they are forced to
believe in him, implied Tillich &mdash; and belief is a commodity
subject to loss. The inner sense of God is a quality of the deeper
psyche [i.e, limbos] &mdash; and not of reason. With the ascendancy of
reason over the psychological awareness of archetypal truth, the way for
rationalism and ultimately for materialism and atheism became wide open.
<b>Thus, says Jung, and agrees Tillich, the West was lost.</b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the West was lost to spiritual interiority, all
that remained was belief, or the religious euphemism for it, faith.
&mdash; <a class="fn">
SA Hoelle,<span> (1989) <cite>Jung and the Lost Gospels</cite>
(Quest Publishing, Wheaton IL).
</span></a> emphasis added.
</blockquote>

<p>The assumption always seems to be that the &lsquo;experience of
god&rsquo; or &lsquo;spiritual interiority&rsquo;, or the bicameral
voice that made our difficult decisions for us, was valuable and
something we want to return to. A less nostalgic view might see the
bicameral voices as a stopgap measure that saw us through a difficult
transition until we could stand on our own feet.

<p>Jung, like all who <a class="fn">seek nirvana,<span>
Bowing to colloquial usage. I write &lsquo;nirvana&rsquo;
where, strictly speaking, one should perhaps use &lsquo;samadhi&rsquo;.
Recall the end note to Ch. 1.
</span></a> was sure of its reality and value, considering it an
experience necessary for spiritual maturity. He always saw metaphysical
reality dwelling in the human unconscious, in the form of archetypes
that transcend individual experience. This led him to feel that the
subjective nature of nirvana did not disqualify it as
&lsquo;real&rsquo;. This is a valid hypothesis which we might formalize
as &lsquo;Metaphysical archetypes are encoded in DNA&rsquo;, since there
is no other biological way to transmit information between generations.
&lsquo;Archetype&rsquo; is no more unlikely a concept than
&lsquo;instinct&rsquo;, and perhaps no harder to encode, so as DNA
reading progresses, such questions will become answerable. Or not, if
nirvana is <i>not</i> a spiritual experience. What if it is, as
suggested <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#35">above</a>, merely a transient
return to the infant&apos;s state of absolute egoism? What becomes of
&lsquo;reality&rsquo;, &lsquo;value&rsquo;, &lsquo;spiritual

<p>A question often asked is how something as obvious as vocal

<p>Jaynes, as a sheltered academic, may have assumed that
introspection was a general property of contemporary humans, but that
seems overly optimistic. Table 2.2 stretches the development of
introspective consciousness over a larger range of intermediate states,
allowing them to overlap, and reinforcing the idea of consciousnesss as
a staged development, not necessarily completed.

<p>Logic insists that the strandlopers who left Africa had more
going for them than the Chimpanzoid OS of pure instinct. Later behavior
suggests 2 lines of development, with cortical dominance in the left
column of Fig. 2.3 and limbic in the right, but what went on before we
departed from Africa is mysterious, and 160,000 years of experiment are
represented in Fig. 2.3 only by the branches above the dashed Out Of
Africa line and the hand-waving suggestions accompanying them. This area
is the realm of the problematic &lsquo;post-chimpanzoid&rsquo; OS.

<p>More complex than the polygenetic black/white skin-color

Operating Systems for the human brain. Time progresses down the
diagram. Two of the transitions are indicated: Klein&apos;s and
Jaspers&apos;s. We are aware of the &lsquo;mind-space&rsquo; available
to the user, shown in yellow in the boxes, but the blue areas we are not
aware of. (I have no clue to what goes on in the brown areas.) AMH, BMH,
and CMH are respectively Anatomically, Bicameral, and Conscious, Modern
Humans. The OOA line indicates only that some diversification of brain
development had occurred before we left Africa. Richard Klein,
responding to an earlier version of this sketch, said that he could see
no way to falsify any of it. In this version, the difference between
<i>more</i> and <i>stronger</i> synapses at least offers a starting
point. However, the main purpose of this figure is to stimulate ideas
about how to improve or falsify the multiple hypotheses it incorporates.

<p>Nothing suggests that there are not further improvements in
store, indicated by the &lsquo;Dual-Core&rsquo; system at the bottom
left, in which we would have direct communication with much of what is
now unconscious. Note that the &lsquo;CMH&rsquo; label is closer to the
Freudian OS than the Fundamentalist. This placement is wondering if, in
the absence of the Jaynesian and Freudian developments, our behavior
would have moved on from that of the savannah. Without the imagination
of story tellers, would the idea of &lsquo;I&rsquo; have caught on?

<p class="epi"> &hellip; the tremendous rôle played, in an
individual&apos;s life, by the social environment in which each is born
and reared. One by one, aspects of behaviour which we had been
accustomed to consider invariable complements of our humanity were found
to be merely a result of civilisation, present in the inhabitants of one
country, absent, in another country, and this without a change of race.
&mdash; Margaret Mead, <cite>Coming of Age in Samoa</cite>
</p>

<p>The functioning of a cybernetic system depends both on the
hardware and the operating system. Silicon OSes are regularly upgraded
to take advantage of new hardware features, but this does not happen
automatically with brains. Even though their brains are probably
equipped for introspection, fundamentalists give the impressions of
trying to continue with the bicameral OS. Taking advantage of the
Enlightenment requires serious introspection &mdash; and this is hard
work. Any potential &lsquo;clash of civilizations&rsquo; is fomented by
cultures with the bicameral outlook, incompatible with those influenced
by the Enlightenment.
</p>

<p>Unfazed by the most complicated structure in the known universe,
many people respond to the idea of bicamerality by demanding a
mechanistic explanation. This will be forthcoming soon after we can
explain how a finger moves when we want it to. This
&lsquo;mind-body&rsquo; problem has excersized philosophers throughout
history: Fig. 2.3 offers 2 relevant suggestions:
</p>


<ul>
<li>Perhaps bicamerality did not so much vanish, as go underground,
losing its voice to urges and impulses from our unconscious and
intuition &mdash; no less mysterious. Many plants have juvenile leaves
that serve young plants well, and adult leaves that work better for
adult plants; we might think of Jaynesian bicamerality as our juvenile
OS, and Freudian consciousness as the adult OS.</li>

<li>It is easy to talk of the bicameral&ndash;conscious change as
&lsquo;rewiring&rsquo;, but the brain already has <a class="fn">shorter
interlobe wires<span>
C Cherniak &amp;3a (2002) &lsquo;Global Optimization of
Cerebral Cortex Layout&rsquo;, <cite>Proc Roy Soc Lond Biol Sci</cite>
<b>B252</b>: 13&ndash;18.
</span></a> than a billion other spatial arrangements of the same
components, which is better than we do with computer chips. This makes
literal rewiring of interlobe communications unlikely. The suggested
difference between &lsquo;Freudian&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Fundamentalist&rsquo; OSes is the focus of improvements, with
more abundant synaptical interconnections surviving infant culling in
the cortex leading to the Freudian OS, and stronger synapses and a more
influential limbic system leading to the Fundamentalist OS. These will
not appear in the fossil record, but may continue down the columns.</li>
</ul>


<p>Recent research shows that the brain is more flexible than we
have realized, raising the question of whether an OS change might be
intentionally mediated. Even though the frontal lobe is the likely home
of the OS, and we know little about how to influence it, suppose that we
had a source of bicameral subjects: might we discover brain exercizes
that could update them?
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"
src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
Could we try this on Fundamentalist volunteers?
</p>

<p>A small <a class="fn">example<span>
S Yamaguchi &amp;6a (2003) &lsquo;Synchronization of Cellular
Clocks in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus&rsquo; <cite>Science</cite>
<b>302</b>: 1408&ndash;1412.
</span></a> of the blue-to-yellow transition might be the ability
to access more directly the clock cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN) that manage our circadian rhythm and let us estimate the passage
of time. Add a few cells to the 20,000 in the SCN and we might be able
to say, &lsquo;It&apos;s 18:15&rsquo; with an error of 5 minutes.
</p>

<p>Although &lsquo;fundamentalist&rsquo; is something of a
pejorative these days, the utility of the OS of this name depends
entirely upon the belief that drives the system. A brain driven by
end-times eschatology or jihad is not helpful; the same brain driven by
an Eirenic and Gaian belief would be distinctly useful. Research on how
to encourage such a switch could be helpful.

<p class="epi">[T]he brain changes its very structure with each
different activity it performs, perfecting its circuits so it is better
suited to the task in hand &hellip;. [This is] surely one of most
extraordinary discoveries of the 20th century. &mdash; Norman Doidge
[tense modified].
</p>

<p>To those familiar with the view of the brain as a collection of
specialized, hard-wired processors located in specific areas (the
accepted view since the Enlightenment) the idea of changing its
operating system will seem wild speculation and unjustifiable
science-fiction. On the other hand, a lot of little-known work has been
done in recent decades.
</p>

<p>Beginning with Paul Bach-y-Rita in the 1960s, there has been a
gradual recognition that while the identified local processors are among
the most efficient regions of the brain, perhaps 80% of their
functionality can be carried out by the learned rewiring of other areas,
sometimes neighboring, sometimes improbably distant and known for
efficiency in their own specialties. Table 2.4 offers a sampling of
known phenomena.

<p>Inevitably, perhaps, neuroplasticity has been popularized to the
point of becoming a bandwagon for the self-help movement. This is good
to the extent that it helps individuals with problems, but studies which
seek to understand how a culture changes its mental operating system
have been neglected. It is encouraging to find that the 2 processes that
underlie neuroplasticity are those hypothesized at the top of Fig. 2.3:
<i>more</i> synapses on the one hand, and <i>stronger</i> synapses on
the other. Nevertheless, the question of
how bicamerality (or other operating systems) diffuse into a
culture
	<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"
src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
is one that remains to be investigated. Moken children learning to
see clearly underwater are apparently persuaded by cultural expectation
that this is possible, so they do it without conscious effort. This is
precisely the manner in which one expects brain operating systems to be
formed.

<h5><a href="#id.Bk"> The <i>Qarin</i> </a></h5>
<a class="tri" href="#38">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a>

<p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of <a href="#F2.3">Fig.
.3</a> is the label &lsquo;Qarin&rsquo; for the OS contemporaneous with
the Jaynesian. The name comes from the invisible companion described as
a &lsquo;double&rsquo; by Breasted and Budge <a href="#29">above</a>,
and called <i>qarina</i> in Hausa and <i>qarin</i> in Arabic (well known
to Mohammed, as will appear <a href="../_D/D15.shtml#05">below</a>). For
now, it provides a name for an OS that Jaynes acknowledged only
parenthetically &mdash; and which, I suggest, formed the other end of
the bicameral continuum.
</p>

<p>Militca Žurkovič (who does not mention Jaynes) offers a
psychological approach to the Doppelganger of literature which
encompasses both bicamerality and the <i>qarin</i>: &lsquo;the double
shows in graphic forms the tension between <q>laws of human society</q>
and the resistance of the unconscious mind to these laws&rsquo;, noting
that
</p>

<blockquote>dialogues between the self and the double are
increasingly acknowledged as being colloquies within the self: the
double has become an aspect of the personal and interpersonal life, a
manifestation of unconscious desire. &mdash; <a class="fn">M Žurkovič
(2000).<span>
	&lsquo;The Double as The "Unseen" of Culture: Toward a
Definition of Doppelganger&rsquo; <cite>Facta Universitatis Series:
Linguistics and Literature</cite> <b>2</b>(#7): 121&ndash;128.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The major differences implied by the paired OSes are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Qarin&apos;s right temporal lobe (?) does not develop a
strong sense of personality. </li>

<li>The mode of influence is not necessarily vocal for the Qarin,
and is not specified.</li>

<li>The intent of its guidance is not social or beneficial, but the
satisfaction of primal desires, as Freud said of the id.</li>
</ul>


<p class="flu">Think of the Qarin as the parent of today&rsquo;s
Fundamentalist OS: unreflective, very sure of itself, conservative, and
more open to the aspirations of the darker aspects of human nature. It
may be that empathy, compassion, altruism, and socialization depend upon
the ability of the &lsquo;other&rsquo; hemisphere
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"

<p>Bicameral instructions are audible, apparently arising from the
right-hemisphere. Our principal speech centers are Broca&apos;s (frontal
lobe) and Wernicke&apos;s (temporal) areas in the left hemisphere:

</span></a> misconstrued as an angel, demon, extraterrestrial,
ghost, muse, or god &mdash; a conclusion difficult to avoid when it
spoke! Our reluctance to move past supernatural misconstructions is such
that this interpretation has probably done more to marginalize Persinger
than to confirm Jaynes&apos;s ideas. Nevertheless, <a
href="../_A/A01.shtml#F1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> can now be shortened by
dropping its ultimate souce, as in Fig. 2.4. The internal signal, heard
as the voice of a god, is the brain&apos;s executive telling the
follower what to do, triggered by the stress of having to make a
decision (or correct the behavior of a nation).

<p>The &lsquo;single most comprehensive, wide-ranging, imaginative
hypothesis available&rsquo; has attracted surprisingly little attention
considering its importance. If Jaynes is right &mdash; and all the
evidence suggests that he is &mdash; the bicameral hypothesis lays bare
the arbitrary nature of revealed religion and explains why prophets were
so sure that they were transmitting the word of god. It reveals the true
nature of gods as autonomous mental agents of the evolving operating
system. Think of them as alternate personalities, inflexibly laying down
the rules. Our earliest religious texts are not derived from
supernatural authority, but belong wholly to unconscious sociology.
</p>

<p>We can dismiss charges of manipulation and charlatanry against
the early prophets, because bicamerality seems to have suppressed the
incipient political chicanery of chimpanzees in favor of smoothly
working communities. The revival of deception must wait for a conscious
mind. The rules of the prophets belong to evolutionary psychology and
the ethology of the unconscious, chosen by the blind forces of natural
selection. The &lsquo;singer to his clan, in the dim red dawn of
man&rsquo; unconsciously shaped the sagas that shaped his tribe, so that
groups and stories co-evolved, and the ones that worked best became the
foundational epics of early city states. It is unfortunate that the
milieu was Late Neolithic, when population density crowded out foragers
and warfare became a vital component of survival, for this left our
early religions tainted by the cult of the warrior.
</p>

<p>Jaynes suspected that language had not evolved sufficiently to
support a  bicameral voice until 10 ka, and I am pushing this moment
back another 25,000 years. There is little evidence for this &mdash; but
note that the Antikythera mechanism pushed our development of analog
computers back a totally unexpected 2100 years with a single lucky find.
The apparently unchanging nature of relict tribes from the 60-ka African
exodus, and their ability to cross 90 km of water, lend some support to
the idea of effective verbal communication by 50 ka.
</p>

<p>We cannot assign a single date for the birth of consciousness,
but psychohistorians might be able to draw
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"
src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
temporal maps of the decline of bicamerality because its passing
produces deep changes in cultural behavior. Any new way of looking at
history will produce new insights, and thinking in terms of the dawning
of consciousness being a local affair might explain many anomalies.
</p>

<p>We also need research into the &lsquo;operating systems&rsquo;
of our
<a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#14"><img class="im"
src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
prophets, because not all of them were bicameral. Table 2.5 is a

question &mdash; which is one for experts &mdash; has hardly been
raised, let alone studied.
