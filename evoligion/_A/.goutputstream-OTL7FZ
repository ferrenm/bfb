<p class="epi">Today&apos;s humans approach their social and physical environment with a stone-age brain. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	Detlef Fetchenhauer (2009)°<span>&lsquo;Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion &ndash; What They Can and What They Cannot Explain (Yet)&rsquo; Ch. 19 in E Voland, W Schiefenhoevel (eds.) <cite>The Biological Evolution of Religious Mind and Behavior</cite> (Springer, Berlin): 279&ndash;291.

<p>While the epigraph explains many anomalies of human behavior, there is no reason why it should be universally true. The brain&apos;s hardware has been modified by some of the hundreds of actively evolving genes of the last myrrienium, and the changes have not reached either fixation (dominance of a single allele) or equilibrium (where a pair of alleles offers a survival advantage). There is good evidence that the software has evolved also &mdash; and again, in different ways in different environments. We should be prepared to consider that some of the differences that we find in world views stem from real differences in the way brains work.</p>

<p>Some of us, like the traditional prophets, still hear the words of god. The only known instrument that can do this is the human brain. Looking for the mechanism responsible for this remarkable process, Emanuel Swedenborg, the polymath mystic and anatomist whose work gave rise to an unintended <a href="http://www.swedenborg.org/Beliefs.aspx">religious sect</a>, made a comprehensive but unsuccessful search for the anatomical seat of the soul &mdash; the putative recipient of the divine signal. Ongoing research into the structure and function of the brain has suggested some possibilities &mdash; but as Fig. 1.1 suggests, the four transmission steps &mdash; </p>
<ol>
<li>the original reception,
<li>the filtering by the prophet,
<li>the comprehension of his disciples, and
<li>the eventual reduction to scripture</li>
</ol>

alt="A-Images/1.1_ChainOfCommandC.jpg. The signal-to-noise ratio of revelation decreases at each stage of transmission: from Coyotl to prophet there is  whatever noise is characteristic of the signal path (whatever it is). The prophet adds noise both when he interprets the signal, and when he transmits the signal to disciples The production of scripture adds yet more noise." />

Chain of Transmission. In the real world, all signal transmission is accompanied by noise, and written Scripture is 4 steps removed from Coyotl. Each step raises a different suite of unresolved questions and needs critical analysis. The all-important link is what goes on in the mind of the proximate source, so here we look briefly at this intermediate transducer.

<p class="flu">are all subject to noise, and none is understood in sufficient detail to justify the supreme importance we attach to the end product. (Ordinarily, <i>all</i> signals are accompanied by noise, but if noise does not affect <i>your</i> religion, think how it has corrupted the <i>other</i> religions! The Scriptures of Krishna, Moses, Paul, and Muhamad &mdash; whose followers have been known to wage wars of annihilation against eachother &mdash; cannot all report the divine message correctly, or they wouldn&apos;t fight.) Everything we have to work with is hearsay, even if we hear it ourselves. Faith &mdash; which we too often substitute for critical analysis &mdash; is a poor substitute for the long-lost community certainty, <i>independent of intermediates such as priests and scripture</i>, that characterized religion when it worked.</p>

<p>Our inidividual preference for Coyotl&apos;s <i>words</i> or <i>works</i> may not be voluntary, but a reflection of the <a  class="fn">triune structure°<span>
	PD MacLean (1952) &lsquo;Some psychiatric implications of physiological studies on frontotemporal portion of limbic system (visceral brain)&rsquo; <cite>Electroencephalogr Clin. Neurophysiol</cite> <b>4</b>: 407-418.
</span></a> of our brains. At the core is the old reptilian brain stem. This is surmounted by the mammalian midbrain, or <a class="fn"><i>limbos</i>°,<span>
	Usually called the the &lsquo;limbic system&rsquo;, it is more of an omnium gatherum than a system and in any case, <i>limbos</i> is neater. Soft <i>s</i>, as in &lsquo;glucose&rsquo;, not &lsquo;-oze&rsquo; as in the plural of limbo &mdash; whether dances or homes for unbaptized souls &mdash; which should be pluralized as for the <i>Solanaceae</i>: &lsquo;limboes&rsquo;.
</span></a> and that in turn by the neocortex, most highly developed in primates. Each layer has a different structure, and retains a certain autonomy. Panic is the reptilian brain taking control, as when a parachutist claws through jacket and muscle and bares his left ribs, hunting for the D-ring release on his right side. Falling in love is a task for the limbos, not necessarily with more success than the parachutist. Philosophy happens in the prefrontal lobe of the neocortex &mdash; with the same chance of success.</p>

<p>The reptilian brain is concerned with preservation and homeostasis of essential systems &mdash; circulatory, pulmonary, digestive, ionic, thermal, &amp;c. It keeps us alive during a vegetative coma, handles aggression and repetitive behavior, and runs involuntary responses. It is inflexible, paranoid, obsessive, compulsive, ritualistic, prejudiced, and cannot learn from mistakes. Its rituals were the original way that individuals interacted, as in the stereotyped courtship behavior of birds. It knows only binary options: dominant/submissive, potential mate/rival, dinner/diner. It has 4 radio-button switches for the &lsquo;4 Fs&rsquo;: feeding, fighting, fleeing, and fornication. It cares not a whit for Coyotl, and would be irrelevant to religion except that it very much likes ritual. The cerebellum seems to store kinetic memory, such as bicycle balancing and the fingering of a piano concerto. The reptilian brain would run a minimalist and unpleasant human culture, and there are people who still seem to see the world in reptilian terms, but even if velociraptors could open doors, the Chicxulub impactor put an end to the direct development of such a culture.</p>

</p>

<p>The mammalian <i>limbos</i> is a jumble of specialized structures named as often appearance as for function, since functions are still poorly understood. This is seen in Fig. 1.3, where various ill-defined &lsquo;nuclei&rsquo; are indicated by abbreviations. The unlabelled light areas on the right are &lsquo;white matter&rsquo;, nerves interconnecting the data-processing grey-matter cortex.

</figcaption></figure>


<p>The limbos is preverbal and communicates with signals. Those sent to the body travel by hormones and autonomic nerves. Those sent to people include body language, facial expression, inarticulate sounds, and pheromones. Cats and seals have signalaries of about 200 signals, lacking syntax and grammar, conveying emotions, simple commands, and survival information.</p>

<p>Limbic truth is sometimes instinctive, as in retaliation to pain. Sometimes it is learned by observing parents, as in the formation of prejudices. And sometimes it is simply mysterious, as in our <a class="fn">choice of mates°.<span>
	A clue to choice of mates is the little studied genetic sexual attraction which results when family members separated early meet later in life. The attraction may be intergenerational, and occurs even if the relationship is intellectually understood. The instinctive incest ban between near relatives is formed by growing up together before age 6.
</span></a> Limbic truth is biochemical, and as unconcerned with logic as a cat. What it is <i>not</i> is a careful analyzer of facts. The adjective &lsquo;happy-clappy&rsquo;, describing evangelical Christians, depicts a limbic response.</p>

<p>The limbos matters to us because it is the seat of Instinct-1, the alpha-male dominance of social animals. It seeks pleasure, avoids pain, and nuances the reptilian responses to produce haute cuisine, feuds and friendship, suspicion, mother love, pair bonding, infatuation, and romance. Its endocrine signals affect the body physiologically. Adrenaline is the master signal for explosive action, whether fighting or fleeing. Less surely identified biochemicals persuade us we are <a class="fn">in love:°<span>
	D Tennov (1999) <cite>Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love</cite> (Scarborough House, NYC).
</span></a> Neural growth factor is important for the formation of new synapses; PEA (phenylethylamine) seems responsible for a lot of the effect; oxytocin (the biochemical of trust) and dopamine figure importantly but transiently (3 years is a long time). This mix plays much the same role in attachments between dogs, in bonding between <a class="fn">dogs and humans°<span>
	JS Odendaal, RA Meintjes (2003) &lsquo;Neurophysiological correlates of affiliative behaviour between humans and dogs&rsquo; <cite>Vet. J.</cite> <b>165</b>(#3): 180-181.
</span></a> &mdash; and probably in some religious experiences although this seems not to have been studied.</p>

<p>We are just as irrational in our choice of group myth as we are in matters of romance. <a  class="fn">Bruce Hood°<span>
	B Hood (2009) <cite>SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable</cite> (HarperOne, NYC).
</span></a> has shown the importance of the limbos in the formation of our fundamental mindset, because our initial babyhood interpretation of the world is limbic while the cortex is forming. Consequently, our &lsquo;instinctive&rsquo; limbic ideas form a persistent background to our adult thinking, usually at variance with later cortical information.
</p>

<p>Our susceptibility to superstitions, the persistent appeal of the supernatural, and the &lsquo;something more&rsquo; than obvious reality that William James described as the background to religion, all stem from the limbic thinking of our 2-year-old selves, and offer an indication of what it might be like to be a cat.</p>

<p>Short-term limbic messengers persist until they are cleared from the bloodstream. The <a class="fn">tears of grief°<span>
	WH Frey (with M Langseth 1985) <cite>Crying: The Mystery of Tears</cite> (Winston Press, Minneapolis): 147.
</span></a> apparently remove the stress hormones of grief. Grief is a derived emotion, as the limbos grew subtle with time. Once, orgasm ensured propagation of the species. But brain complexity takes time to develop and young mammals require long parental care. Natural selection taught the limbos mother love. Two parents increase the chance of survival. The limbos learned  pair bonding. Grief is a by-product of these needs &mdash; as are long-term memory and pattern recognition. The first thing a newborn seal pup and mother do is bark at eachother. All seals sound alike to us, but after this imprinting ritual, mother and pup can identify eachothers&apos; voices in a din that can be heard miles offshore of the nursery.</p>

<p>Being attuned to one&apos;s limbos is highly regarded, but it does not confer bragging rights. Anything our limbos can do, an elephant&apos;s can do better. The limbos learns by example and experience, but only with great difficulty by deliberate intention. It is much harder to unlearn something limbic than to learn it: the old saw has it that it takes a minute to meet some one special, an hour to appreciate her qualities, a day to fall in love &mdash; and a <a class="fn">lifetime to forget°.<span>
	I cannot vouch for &lsquo;lifetime&rsquo;: ~60 years and counting.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Buddhism does not recognize <a class="fn">&lsquo;emotions&rsquo; as a class°<span>
	P Ekman &amp;3a (2005) &lsquo;Buddhist and Psychological Perspectives on Emotions and Well-Being&rsquo; <cite>Current Directions in Psychological Science</cite> <b>14</b>(#2): 59&ndash;63.
</span></a> in the Western manner, but distinguishes between attitudes that help achieve enlightenment and those <a class="fn">that do not°.<span>
	&lsquo;Tommyrot!&rsquo;, says my Buddhist adviser, who threatens to produce a list of 84,000 emotions &mdash; <i>all negative</i> &mdash; derived from the 3 root <i>kleshas</i> of ignorance, attachment, and aversion. The problem is one of definition. &lsquo;Emotion&rsquo; covers &lsquo;all [i.e., both positive and negative] natural instinctive states of mind deriving from one&apos;s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others&rsquo;, but there seems to be no single word in Pali, Sanskrit, or Tibetan that includes both positive and negative feelings. &lsquo;Instinctive&rsquo; is the key word when starting from the limbos.
</span></a> Since both are limbic concerns, much Buddhist teaching is aimed at the limbos, with an emphasis on compassion, an emotion/helpful-attitude in generally <a class="fn">short supply°.<span>
	Recognizing that women are more likely to be compassionate than men, the Dalai Lama has pointed out that his successor might well be a woman. &lsquo;If a female Dalai Lama is needed, one will automatically appear.&rsquo;
</span></a> Because the limbos is preverbal, communicating with it requires allegorical symbolism. Nevertheless, personal experience suggests that there are mental disciplines which can, in an hour or two of sufficient stress, induce limbic effects that, however desperately desired at the time, are ultimately undesirable and apparently irreversible. (There seems to be no way to induce <i>desirable</i> effects so easily.) Anyone serious about rewiring an emotional response might do well to find a Buddhist advisor.</p>

<p class="epi">The still dominant model of archaeology &hellip; states essentially that all significant cognitive, cultural and intellectual evolution occurred in the last half of the Late Pleistocene, i.e. in the last &lt;1% of the duration of human evolution. This is incompatible with the record, which shows that there was a continuous enlargement of the brain throughout hominin evolution, accelerating in the last two million years of this process to the point of yielding a grotesquely outsized organ. No explanation of the past that [fails to take] this into adequate consideration can be considered biologically viable or plausible. &mdash; <a class="fn" href="http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/semiotics/cyber/rbednarik1.pdf">
	Robert Bednarik (2006)°.<span><cite>Semiotix Course</cite> &lsquo;Cognition and symbolism in human evolution&rsquo;.
</span></a>

<p>The essentially human part of the brain is the prefrontal lobe of the neocortex (forward of the motor/sensory area). A true novelty in nature, its major growth (Fig. 1.3) corresponds with the appearance of modern man. The correlation between brain size and intelligence is 0.50 in both rats and humans, and 0.30 is sufficient to account for the increase in size if intelligence is <a class="fn">positively selected°.<span>
	L van Valen (1974) &lsquo;Brain size and intelligence in man&rsquo; <cite>Am J Phys Anthrop</cite> <b>40</b>: 417-424.
<br>-------------------<br>
	The changing environment of the Pleistocene selected for intelligence; human interactions in the Anthropocene all too often <i>de</i>select the intelligent (the Shoah, Pol Pot, Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom, the US government&apos;s response to whistle-blowers, &hellip;). On these grounds, perhaps we should welcome climate destabilization, since it seems likely to decimate the population, perhaps selectively.
</span></a> <i>H. erectus</i> made identical hand axes for 1.6 million years; <i>H. sapiens</i> has built ever more complex tools. Some 200 <a class="fn">young genes°<span>

</span></a> are involved in the development of the fetal human brain, suggesting that it is the current locus of human evolution. Despite Bednarik&apos;s epigraphic focus on continuity of development, intelligence itself is not necessarily a linear function of complexity. Just as with technology, interactions may result in exponential change.</p>

<p>The <b>prefrontal lobe</b> is the seat of &lsquo;higher functions&rsquo;: analytical thinking, abstract thought, judgement, social and ethical behavior, mathematical skills, problem solving, intuition, and forethought &mdash; the last being such a recent skill that we still remember <a class="fn">Prometheus°.<span>
	The development of Prometheus (from thief in Proto-Indo-European myth to trouble-maker in Hesiod to creator of humans in Plato) deserves more attention than I have so far found. &lsquo;Pro-metheus = forethought&rsquo; is folk etymology from Roman times.

	Jack Weinberg&apos;s (1964) &lsquo;Don&apos;t trust anyone over 30&rsquo; is a perverse recognition of this feature.
</span></a> Recognizing the consequences of this, if not the process, ancient Egypt, Judaism, and Rome under <i>Lex Pappia</i> set the age of adulthood at 30 years.

Brain Volume. If genus <i>Homo</i> has specialized in anything, it is brain volume, which doubled between <i>Australopithecus</i> and <i>Homo</i>, and rose steeply with <i>H. sapiens</i>. Only during the thin blue strip at the right have we had more than Instinct-1 of the alpha male going for us. As the average volume approaches 1500 cc, the possibility of Instinct-2 increases. Ultimately, we come to the possibility of religion and its ability to leave behind the animal kingdom. {Various sources}.

<p>This late completion seems to be demanded by reproduction, which has a higher evolutionary priority than clear thinking. We seldom fall in love when we approach mate selection analytically; it helps if we are blind to possible deficiencies in potential mates. It appears that by the time we are 30, we have, statistically, raised enough children to relax the reproductive necessity, and can devote our later years to other priorities. If this leads to dissolution of the family, the children may suffer psychological damage, but as long as they reproduce in turn, evolution does not care about their problems. Long before the brain-rewiring sweep was discovered, this chain of events led psychologist <a class="fn">Robert Rimmer°<span>
	RH Rimmer (1965) <cite>The Harrad Experiment: Special 25th Anniversary Edition</cite> (Prometheus Books, Buffalo NY, 1990).
</span></a> to suggest 1st marriage at 15 to a 30-year old, 2nd marriage at 30 to a 15-year old, and 3rd marriage at 45+ to another 45+.</p>

<p>Despite the manifold abilities of the frontal lobe, Egas Moniz was 1949 Nobel laureate (Medicine) for prefrontal lobotomy. As simplified by Walter Freeman, one slid an icepick upward along the nasal side of the eyeball and swung the pick right and left, treating 150 patients a day for criminal tendencies, homosexuality, and childhood misbehavior. One demonstrable effect was to increase the job satisfaction of <a class="fn">burocrats°<span>
	The paper clip is a Norwegian invention, suggesting that they understand &lsquo;bureaucracy&rsquo; better than anyone else. We celebrate this by using their spelling, rather than the French.
</span></a> &mdash; a tragic comment on a common modern job. Drugs like Prozac have replaced the icepick, possibly more reversibly.</p>

<p>The direction of influence between layers of the brain is primarily outward. To curtail bacteria, the reptilian brain can induce a fever in minutes, but it takes years for a yogi to learn to alter his body temperature by sending cortical signals inward. Similarly, it is difficult to influence the limbos with rational arguments. (Try persuading your teen-age daughter that her boy friend is unsuitable, or a creationist that evolution is a biological fact.) In the other direction, it is easy to distract cortical logic with irrelevant limbic input. Show a man a sexy woman and his ability to make rational decisions <a class="fn">decreases°.<span>
	B van de Bergh, S Dewitte (2006) &lsquo;Digit ratio (2D:4D) moderates the impact of sexual cues on men&apos;s decisions in ultimatum games&rsquo; <cite>Proc Biol Sci</cite> <b>273</b>(#1597): 2091&ndash;2095.
</span></a> Yet because limbic responses kept our ancestors alive, we trust them below the level of conscious thought. Mother love supersedes rational decisions in moments of crisis. Addictive &lsquo;recreational&rsquo; drugs act on the limbos. Politicians and cats devote their attention to the unconscious decisions of our limbos. An unqualified presidential candidate avoids cortical debates &mdash; while spending millions to persuade you you&apos;d like to have a beer with him.</p>

<p>An unresolved question is the extent to which the cortical/limbic balance is set by genetics and by experience. How much does mental laziness contribute to
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research" /></a>
limbic dominance? Does collegiate acceptance of a &lsquo;gentleman&apos;s C&rsquo; discourage adult refinement of the frontal lobe?</p>

</span></a> of our solar system. He added that leaded gasoline had so polluted the earth&apos;s surface that we all carried 10 times the lead burden that we were adapted to. Since trace amounts of lead adversely affect brain development, he asked the logical question: &lsquo;How do we know that we aren&apos;t all 10% stupider than we were before we invented tetraethyl lead?&rsquo;. The answer, 50 years later, is Fig. 1.5, where the circled point &mdash; compatible with the peaks of Fig. 1.6 &mdash; will indeed make us 10% stupider.

<p>Had Dr Patterson listened to the garbled story that some read into Coyotl&apos;s prophets, none of these good things would have happened. US administrations that believe YECs rather than the actual record want to undo these good things in aid of corporate profits &mdash; despite legal opinion that &lsquo;Taking a hard line against airborne lead has generated billions in enhanced gross domestic product and achieved a very satisfying <a class="fn">measure of social justice&rsquo;°.<span>
	42 USC 109(b)(1)(2000)
</span></a> Which story one believes is thus important to the mental development of our children.</p>

<p>There are, perhaps, 2 morals to this story. The first is that Coyotl&apos;s <i>words</i> are easy to understand if you don&apos;t ask for details: &lsquo;Ah, magic!&rsquo;. Reading the story Coyotl <i>recorded</i> in the natural world is difficult and subtle, requiring study, perception, and probably an IQ above 130. The second is that we are now so numerous that it is easy for us to alter the global environment without noticing.</p>

<p>If you elect to read Coyotl&apos;s record, you should start preparing about the time you learn to read books. It generally takes 20 dedicated years before you can make a contribution. In compensation, there is no occupation more rewarding, more exciting, more attuned to the universe, more fun, or more likely to leave a better world for your children and our fellow passengers on Spaceship Earth. Be warned, though, for as Bruce Sterling put it in <cite>Distraction</cite>,</p>

<p>I am about to say that the average IQ of <i>H. sapiens</i> matters greatly. However, there are caveats. Some seem to believe that individual differences of 0.01 IQ point are significant, as in Fig. 1.7, and represent a permanent property of an individual&apos;s brain. Yet the very existence of <b><i>g</i></b>, the &lsquo;Gaussian-distributed generalized intelligence&rsquo; that IQ purports to measure, is still <a class="fn">debated°,<span>

<p>The place where differences matter is in the tail at the high end. Here, a small increment in <i>mean</i> IQ makes a large difference in relative numbers. (The details are explored by du Lion&apos;s &lsquo;<a class="fn" href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/fuzzy.htm">method of thresholds&rsquo;°,<span>
	La Griffe Du Lion (2000) &lsquo;Aggressiveness, Criminality And Sex Drive By Race, Gender And Ethnicity&rsquo; <b>2</b>(#11). Click for &lsquo;threshold -analysis&rsquo; plots. Accessed 2015-06-06.
</span></a> which is required reading for anyone concerned with race and gender differences.) Nevertheless, in individual cases, small differences are irrelevant. Some quick examples:</p>

<p>1) A college housemate and I had an IQ difference of 56 points. High-school advisers had tried to shunt him into vocational school, where he might learn a trade. He didn&apos;t shunt &mdash; and he and I fought for the top spot in chemistry for 2 years, without deciding the issue. My chum was a late bloomer (in other words, IQ is not immutable). He joked that he learned slowly but never forgot anything &mdash; and dated only women named Pat. (He had a perfectly fine Pat in attendance when I knew him, so his system worked &mdash; whatever it was in reality.) Ten years later he was publishing on enzymatic signal transduction across biomembranes, so his system worked there too, and his CV (concentrated on an important problem) is more impressive than mine (scatttered all over the place).</p>

<p>2) In the other direction, academia is inhabited by high-IQ people. Yet any Faculty Senate meeting will disabuse you of a relation between IQ and practicality. I don&apos;t recall a single Senate resolution that had any <a class="fn">discernible effect°.<span>
	This may be a biased example. &lsquo;We&rsquo; were a specialized and world-class campus of, alas, an otherwise 4th-rate institution (the most recent math book in the main-campus library was published in 1911). We sent the short straw to the Senate meetings.
</span></a> Fortunately.</p>

<p>3) That there are different kinds of intelligence is obvious, and MIT and Harvard attract different types. Early attempts to amalgamate the schools were resisted by both student bodies, each knowing itself superior. Both sorts are &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo;, but the women of nearby Wellesley unconsciously distinguish them in conversation. Their dates are &lsquo;Harvard men&rsquo; by preference and &lsquo;MIT boys&rsquo; if nothing better is on offer &mdash; a keen assessment of <a class="fn">social skills°.<span>
	In practical terms, Harvard men had 5&ndash;7 years more experience in the art of seduction.

	Femininists, relax. Young females may take menarche as an obvious mark of womanhood; young males think of &lsquo;women&rsquo; as the parental generation, unsuitable as sexual partners, while &lsquo;girls&rsquo; are their generation and fair game.
</span></a> make this distinction, an MIT administrator took notice, and instituted an elective &lsquo;<a class="fn">charm school&rsquo;°.<span>
	MIT&apos;s problem is now recognized as a mild form of Asperger&apos;s Syndrome, the &lsquo;high-IQ version of autism&rsquo;. I wondered, once, why the chattering classes whose interests cover the range of the soap opera didn&apos;t get tagged with a Syndrome of their own. Then I came across Steve Silberman&apos;s article &lsquo;The Geek Syndrome&rsquo; in <cite>Wired</cite> 9.12: &lsquo;[T]he first tools on earth might have been developed by a loner sitting at the back of the cave, chipping at thousands of rocks to find the one that made the sharpest spear, while the <i>neurotypicals</i> chattered away in the firelight.&rsquo;

<p>Low IQ is not <i>necessarily</i> an impediment to contributing to society. High IQ does not guarantee intelligent real-world decisions. Still, the ascendancy of humans is the result of intelligence. Our mean IQ is arbitrary (it might have been different), but not accidental (it was needed for our children to survive). We had to be smarter than our predators, and once we were, we incidentally took over the world. Initially, it took 8 or more children to maintain the population.

</span></a> The green curve at 115 in <a href="#F1.8">Fig. 1.8</a> is an estimate for Ashkenazis. Note the disproportionate increase in the colored bands for upward shifts of the mean. (However, if the Ashkenazis were <i>selected</i> from a population with a mean of 100, rather than <i>evolving</i> to 115, their numbers would not follow a normal distribution and might be much narrower than shown.)

	JR Flynn (1987) &lsquo;Massive IQ gains in 14 nations: what IQ tests really measure&rsquo; <cite>Psychological Bulletin</cite> <b>101</b>: 171-191.

	 R Lynn (1990) &lsquo;The role of nutrition in secular increases of intelligence&rsquo; <cite>Personality and Individual Differences</cite> <b>11</b>: 2730&ndash;285.
</span></a> or a generally more stimulating environment. The increase (now slowing) is comparable to increases in height and brain weight. Again, what probably happened is that the distribution was narrowed by truncation of the low end.
</p>

<p>Neither of the above cases is relevant to the Ice Age, which lasted long enough for mutation (in addition to selection of existing alleles) to exert its influence. Even so, 1.6 points per millennium is insignificant compared to the Flynn effect. The selection would be for whatever increased viability &mdash; specifically, one suspects, for <i>ingenuity</i> in dealing with difficult environmental challenges, and for <i>altruism</i> that helped the local group survive.
</p>

<p>Aldous Huxley (and Classical Greeks before him) noted that human progress depends on genius. Without people from the colored bands of Fig. 1.8, life goes on as it always has, and nothing gets any better. Progress &mdash; soap, books, electric motors to replace slavery, Macadamized roads to replace mud &mdash; depends on exceptional individuals. It helps to remember that there are dozens of human qualities with similar distributions, and that half of us are below normal on each of them. IQ in the 170s with ethics in the 20s (e.g., Richard Nixon) seems to lead to a natural career as a politician or CEO.

IQ Distributions. The blue curve is the standard Wechsler distribution for the US and UK. All curves have a coefficient of variation (σ/mean) = 0.15, where σ is the <a class="fn">standard deviation°.<span>
	&lsquo;Standard deviation&rsquo; σ (sigma) is a measure of the width of a distribution, 15 points for the &lsquo;100&rsquo; curve. 99.5% of the area of a Gaussian lies between ±3σ.

From the subtitle of the Preface, &lsquo;A scientist&apos;s search&rsquo;, it should be clear that  this book is the record of a 20-year learning process. It is emphatically not something for which I could have written an outline when I began, as I had no idea where it was going. Nowhere is this clearer than in Fig. 1.8. My friends &mdash; the people I am comfortable with and can talk to &mdash; mostly inhabit the colored bands of Fig. 1.8. So too do the few blacks I have known or admired (e.g.: a science journalist, a student whose ambition was to clerk for the Supreme Court; George Washington Carver, Morgan Freeman), but they are far more exceptional than I had realized. I was somewhat taken aback to find this figure reproduced on a website that many liberals despise as racist. But unlike the alt-right sites, this one is literate, civil, and mostly well informed (the most egregious error I found was a claim that blacks are unable to speak good English &mdash; obviously by someone who has never visited Jamaica, where the patois is BBC). It cites scholarly references for its statements, and offers a wealth of responsible books. I was equally im- and de-pressed by an essay from someone with more experince: <a href="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/a-white-teacher-speaks-out/"><cite>A White Teacher Speaks Out</cite></a>.

An optimistic view of the near future suggests that if upcoming challenges could lead to further increase at the rate of the Flynn effect (possibly raising the mean of the survivors to 130), we might outlast the century. The pessimist thinks about the background rate compared to the rate of evolution, recalls disappearance of the Ionians, and notes that loss is probable in times of stress. Simple demographics is working against the Flynn effect today.</p>

<p>There has been a phenomenal effort to explain group IQ differences by something other than &lsquo;racist genetics&rsquo;, in the hope of finding environmental effects that can be manipulated. It is relatively easy for environmental factors to <i>decrease</i> IQ: violence in the home of 5-year-olds will knock off <a class="fn">8 points°.<span>

</span></a> But ways to <i>increase</i> IQ have been as hard to find as the Flynn effect is hard to explain. The traditional approach (that one that worked with predators and ice ages) is to let the stupid kill themselves.

<blockquote>While one might expect that at least <i>some</i> linear combination of primary, secondary, and higher education measures could eliminate the statistical significance of IQ, we did not find this to be the case. <b>[&hellip;W]hen policymakers ask the question, &lsquo;What should our human capital policy seek to maximize?&rsquo; it appears that near the top of economist&apos;s list of responses should be the words, &lsquo;National Average IQ&rsquo;.</b> &hellip; In light of the many criticisms of IQ tests, one might have expected that the IQ-growth link would be merely epiphenomenal, something that would fade away when researchers controlled for variables that were strongly related to growth.

</blockquote>

<p>Continuing, they add, &lsquo;It appears that with the exception of increased education, most of the relevant environmental factors primarily exert their influence before the child is 3 years old&rsquo;. Thus the apparent <i>racial</i> correlation in Fig. 1.8 is not necessarily real: In Bangladesh, IQ correlates negatively with arsenic in well water; lead levels in Philippine children may cost them 15 IQ points; Africa still uses leaded gasoline; zinc deficiency lowers <a class="fn">IQ in India°.<span>

</span></a> Malnutrition, civil war, tropical diseases, all reduce brain development. I suspect that school time spent in rote learning of incomprehensible material also has a negative effect on IQ.
</p>

<p>One of the problems is that Things Take Time. The single most helpful tool to improve the <i>functioning</i> IQ of a child is intelligent parents. Progress in IQ increase is thus a generational process, rather than something that will show much effect from short-term political efforts.

<p>There is also the fact that the brain uses about 20% of the body&apos;s energy, so thinking is hard work and we tend not to do it if we don&apos;t have to. The result is that the population operates well below its most intelligent level when life is easy. The result is pathetic. In April 2010, the US Army announced that it was likely to run short of petroleum by 2015, and in May cost-cutting by British Petroleum flooded the Gulf of Mexico with escaping oil. The 2 events seem to have made some impression: blogs were full of &lsquo;How could the government let this happen? Why didn&apos;t they warn us? Why is this greedy oil company drilling with unsafe techniques?&rsquo;, and similar disclaimers of awareness. Balderdash. M King Hubbert told us in 1956 that world oil production would peak shortly after 2000 CE. Earth day in 1970 set the stage for reduction of energy use and employment of alternative sources. Everything we needed to know was public knowledge &mdash; and we let those who profitted from the status quo maintain it. This was not lack of brain-power, but reluctance to apply it to changing the situation</p>

<p>Corporate media and purchased politicians have failed here, so forget them. We have been living with a collective IQ of 75 out of unconcern for what was happening around us &mdash; but we <i>can</i> do better. <i>Read</i>. Investigative journalism, discouraged by the corporate owners of main-stream media, survives on the web: find it. Think about worst-case scenarios. Read. Plan ahead. One of my friends runs a monthly &lsquo;Survival Salon&rsquo; in Pittsburgh, where 40&ndash;100 people gather for discussion of ecology, politics, options, potluck, and folk-singing.</p>

<p>The cortical/limbic difference comes with a price. Most of the problems considered in this book are the result of disputes between the exploratory, investigative cortex, and the cocksure, conservative limbos. Disputes call for a method of evaluating solutions. How do we decide that an answer is true? The limbos and the cortex are orthogonal on this point. They interact only minimally, and they employ the very different criteria of Fig. 1.10.</p>

<p>The horizontal arrow of Limbic Thinking leads to Limbic Truth and belief in Coyotl&apos;s words. The vertical arrow of Cortical Thinking leads to Cortical Truth and belief in Coyotl&apos;s works. A tenet held on faith that conflicts with data and logic will be adjudged false by scientists. Data-supported logical argument that conflicts with dogma will be adjudged false by True Believers. William G. McAdoo put it more bluntly: &lsquo;It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in argument&rsquo;. Each side holds that the other ignores axiomatic facts. The two modes have acquired many names, including <i>mythos</i> and <i>logos</i>, story and system, <i>coeur</i> and <i>raison</i>, and they have been discussed by philosophers <a class="fn">since philosophy was invented°.<span>
	K Armstrong (2000) <cite>The Battle for God</cite> (Ballantine Books, NYC).
</span></a> Pascal made much of them, attributing the difficulty of persuading limbic thinkers by logic to the weakness of reason and the sureness of limbic knowledge. Certainly, as lovers understand, &lsquo;The heart has reasons that reason knows not of&rsquo; &mdash; but this is an area that the limbos specializes in. It would be good not to assume that it is equally adroit in all areas.</p>

Orthogonal Truths. Why religion and science have trouble communicating. &lsquo;Orthogonal&rsquo; describes mathematical functions which do not interact (multliply them together and the answer is 0). This is almost true of the 2 varieties of truth indicated here.

<p> The hardware of individual brains tends to be dominated by one or the other of these arrows, and to have difficulty responding to the other. Note that the colored text suggests the evolutionary function of the 2 arrows, indicating that they are not oppositional but complementary, and both are needed for full functionality. It is unfortunate that the limbic mode is susceptible to the text above &lsquo;Coyotl&apos;s Words&rsquo; (much of which describes successful strategies for dealing with the band&apos;s alpha male).</p>

<p>Logic is a cortical process (although it can be used to defend a limbic position, which is the art of <a class="fn">casuistry.)°<span>
	My favorite example comes from Creationist Denis Bonnette. Warming up, he writes &lsquo;True evolution would have to show that a plant became an animal&rsquo;. [Why? The ancestral kingdom Protoctista contains organisms which are neither plant nor animal. They photosynthesize and they also consume other organisms. Animals are more closely related to fungi than to plants.]
	<br>
	Then, having for unstated reasons decided that &lsquo;the formation of the first woman from the first man&rsquo; must be defensible scientifically, he suggests that an XXY conceptus [a rare but possible genetic error], followed immediately by twinning [1 in 88], followed immediately by two more extremely unlikely events &mdash; the loss of an X by one twin, and the loss of the Y by the other &mdash; is a rational description of Eve being formed from Adam&apos;s rib.&rsquo; [Again, Why? Genesis 2:22 specifically says עלו (tsela = &lsquo;side&rsquo; on 19 occasions; &lsquo;chamber&rsquo; 11; &hellip; &lsquo;rib&rsquo; 2). If we insist on literalism, let us at least be literal! The author of Genesis knew about twins: if he meant twins, he should have said so. Why not just accept Gen 1:27? &lsquo;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.]
	<br>
	The crux of the story &mdash; unnoticed by its creationist author &mdash; is that in his pursuit of scientific defensibility, Bonnette raises a question even more heretical than the one he thinks he answered: If Eve was the XX twin resulting from all of this: Who was her mother?
<br>---------------<br>

</span></a> We process data using the least possible energy, so response will be limbic whenever we let it. Many people fall between the extremes of Fig. 1.10, needing both &lsquo;story&rsquo; and &lsquo;system&rsquo;. The established religions fill this dual need better than science does, which is long on &lsquo;system&rsquo;, but whose &lsquo;stories&rsquo; are more often disquieting than comforting. (Hence conservatives&rsquo; violent denial of global heating.) In general, as the brain matures and adult cortical connections are completed, one&apos;s arrow swings toward the north.</p>

<p><b>Max Weber</b> observed that the directions between the arrows of Fig. 1.10 are not unoccupied. Given particular axioms, <i>anything</i> can be defended as rational. Following tradition takes as little energy as using the limbos and may occasionally work better than cortical planning. An example is the Buddhist temples of Bali, which regulated water flow to rice paddies in an apparently arbitrary manner that let paddies sit dry and idle at times. Western experts hoped to replace a 1000-year-old &lsquo;religious ritual&rsquo; with rational methods producing 3 crops a year. What they got (without letting the paddies dry) allowed pests to grow faster than the rice, so that a bad year would produce <a class="fn">no crop at all°.<span>
	JS Lansing (1991) <cite>Priests and Programmerss: Technologies of Power in the Engineered Landscape of Bali</cite> (Princeton University Press, Princeton).
</span></a> The system had been based on observation and experiment to produce the maximum dependable crop, this rationale had been forgotten over the centuries, and the tradition was perpetuated <i>because it worked</i>.</p>

<p>The lengths the limbos will go to protect its beliefs are nicely illustrated by the M$27 Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. Every exhibit is fake or misinterpretation, but some are cleverly animatronic. Influenced by <cite>Jurassic Park </cite>, its theme-park designer admitted velociraptors to Noah&apos;s Ark &mdash; on the basis of no Biblical support &mdash; and then claimed that they were vegetarian before the Fall of Man. Why speed was needed to capture plants, how peg-teeth dealt with vegetation, and what sickle claws were for, do not interest the limbos, which can only differentiate positions by their emotional affect. The Museum&apos;s postmodern director observes that &lsquo;[Dawkins] has got a position too. It&apos;s just a different one from ours&rsquo; {<cite>GW</cite> 2007-06-08 p42} &mdash; the popoco assumption that all positions are equally valid. The Museum sells creationist books that &mdash; ominously &mdash; visiting school teachers buy in quantity with their own money. An apparently unrelated study found that 26 percent of Americans were <a class="fn">mentally ill°,<span>

</span></a> compared with 5 percent in Nigeria and 4 percent in Shanghai. (The aftermath of the 2016 election  suggests that this number has been rising.)</p>

<p>Limbic stories may be true in 2 important symbolic ways. A common property of persistent limbic stories is that they cannot be verified, and this must once have served a useful purpose. A deeper benefit is that limbic stories supply meaning unavailable to the cortex. Meaning and non-verifiability seem like strange bedfellows. Yet the connection between them, and the evolutionary value of limbic stories, are vital to understanding religion, and we will explore the connection below.</p>

<p>Confusion over the realms of utility of cortical and limbic thinking is at the root of a lot of our troubles. I will take as an axiom that <i>actions speak louder than words,</i> and that this is also true of Coyotl&apos;s activities.</p>

<p>A brain function that is directly related to pothodoxy is &lsquo;confirmation bias&rsquo;. It is easier to confirm an existing idea, than to evaluate a contradictory one fairly. This is part of the appeal of pseudoscience: Random events that reinforce a belief are remembered; events that do not disappear into background noise. It may be fossil behavior left over from the Middle Paleolithic, when we learned everything we needed from our parents before adolescence. True Believers often <i>pride</i> themselves on maintaining their belief in the face of contradictory evidence: this is as good a definition of <i>insanity</i> as we have.  The survival of such traits through the Neolithic is a consequence of human empathy and a resulting reluctance to let people die of incorrect beliefs.</p>

<p>We can watch confirmation bias in action with brain-imaging tools. Show a True Believer that his belief is wrong, and he may suffer brief cognitive dissonance, but it will not be resolved by rational analysis.

<li>The other feature is that <a href="A00.shtml#08">Gibbon&apos;s Gambit</a> &mdash; the ability to change irrational beliefs on demand in a ritual switch &mdash; is that beliefs (primarily <i>religious</i> beliefs) have minimal effect on the real world.

<p>A more sinister and unscrupulous aspect of confirmation bias is exemplified by Fox &lsquo;News&rsquo;, which is mainly commentary aimed at its far-right constituency. A corollary of confirmation bias is confirmation trust: if someone tells you what you want to hear, you tend to trust him &mdash; and to believe the other things he tells you. A survey by Public Policy Polling showed that 74% of Republicans trust Fox News (vs 30% of Democrats), while less biased networks &mdash; ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC &mdash; garnered overall <a class="fn">ratings°<span>
	One might think that 2/3 of the country distrusting its major news sources would be cause for concern. Considering the consensual censorship of important stories (Ch. 19, Media Issues), the distrust is wholly justified. This should inspire an urge to correct the situation. Trash your TVs? Support PBS? Keep media sock puppets out of the FCC!
</span></a> between 31 and 39% {<cite>GW</cite> 2010-02-12 p42}. This is a 40% increase for having your prejudices reinforced, representing a frighteningly easy way to manipulate and polarize the population through applied psychology. The type example is the 2000 Florida election, when Bush cousin John Ellis at Fox News organized a false pre-emptive announcement of a Bush victory. After hearing that lie from their trusted source, Republicans (including the Supreme Court) apparently perceived Al Gore as a sore loser when he asked for a recount. (<i>All</i> recount variants show that Gore had won.)</p>

<p>By design or coincidence, the elderly are as susceptible to Fox News as teenagers are to religious cults. Anecdotal stories of parents being &lsquo;lost&rsquo; to Fox News are so numerous that the effect seems planned, a deliberate and effective <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/28/1281040/-I-also-lost-my-father-to-Fox-News?detail=email#">brain-washing</a> of senior citizens, with drift to the political right, loss of critical ability, retreat from society, and worshipful regard for the ranting heads of Faux News. I am well out of the TV loop, but it seems to me that there should be a market for a device that blocks specific TV programs. If you care for your parents, find one and install it!
</p>

<p>Since confirmation bias suggests that the ever popular TV debates between Christian creationists and evolutionists are counterproductive, I propose a possibly fairer, and certainly more interesting, debate. Despite the excitement of cutting-edge research, the many branches of science have a generally consilient view of the cosmos. To level the debating field, let us ask a Catholic, a Baptist,
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../images/K-BellTheCat3.gif" alt="BelltheCat"></a>
a Mormon, a Jew, a Hindu, a Muslim, and a Scientologist (for instance) to agree on a similarly consilient supernaturlist version, which can then be compared with the naturalistic scientific view.</p>

<h5><a href="#TOC"> Neurotheology </a></h5>
<a class="trs" href="#17">&#9661;</a>

<p>Neurotheology is the intersection of brain research and religious studies. It&apos;s first concern is the classical mind&ndash;body question: How can mere organic matter &mdash; the stuff that frogs are made of &mdash; be all that underpins the abilities of the human mind? Our first answer was dualism, postulating an otherwise undetectable &lsquo;soul&rsquo; to differentiate us from animals, and do the thinking. Unfortunately, this raises more problems than it answers. One is mechanistic: how might matter and soul might interact? The other is existential: how might one demonstrate the existence of the soul? Replacing one hard question by 2 is hardly a forward step.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, let me posit that every advance in hardware, software, and computer science makes it more likely that we will find that the mind&ndash;body problem was a false dichotomy. The properties of the brain <a href="../_F/F24.shtml#27">emerge from complexity</a> in ways that cannot be predicted,and are understandable only in retrospect.

<p>Since dualist theoneurology (in which <i>theo-</i> explains <i>neurology</i>) has led nowhere in the last millennium, we are left with <i>neuro-</i> to explain <i>theology</i>. What properties of the brain led us to the idea of an invisible world, more important than our obvious quotidian home, populated by powerful beings, and operating under strange laws? We take as a working hypothesis that neurotheology is an aspect of brain wiring and brain chemistry. The relevant agents are specialized architecture (differences in microscopic components and their arrangement, implying different behavior), and the neurochemistry of synapses.</p>

<p>Several hundred neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are known. <b>Neurotransmitters</b> are chemicals that carry a signal across the synaptic gap, to be destroyed immediately thereafter. Neurotransmitters not released by the sending neuron, or not promptly deactivated, will cause unexpected behavior.</p>

<p><b>Neuromodulators</b> circulate more widely, and affect all synapses that recognize them, changing the behavior of whole systems. The blood-brain barrier excludes the disturbing psychoactive chemicals that it met during mammalian and primate evolution &mdash; but not the ones it didn&apos;t meet, so these become tools for exploring the brain. Brain operation is a multidimensional process where each neurochemical offers another axis on which to plot graded responses, but this
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
remains to be done. A few behavioral axes have been described at the hand-waving level, with the best characterized summarized in Table 1.3.</p>

Putative Neurological Axes. Research remains so unquantitative that the degree to which these few axes overlap is unknown. Presumably every neurochemical produces its own axis, with a normal set point, and exotic perceptions and behavior when there is either too little or too much. None of these suggested axes is mainstream science, and most of the researchers, however interesting their insights, are viewed sceptically by &lsquo;the establishment&rsquo;.

<p>The best quantified work on brain behavior was completed in 1970, just before the US Congress, panic&apos;d by Timothy Leary&apos;s &lsquo;experiments&rsquo; with LSD, cut off funding for neurochemical research for a generation. 30 years after it appeared, Roland Fischer&apos;s classic &lsquo;Cartography of Ecstatic and Meditative States&rsquo; was still being reviewed and described as &lsquo;<a class="fn" href="http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/relexp/reviews/review_fischer01.htm">extremely influential&rsquo;°.<span>

</span></a> It earns this praise for putting numbers on the 2 commonest varieties of religious experience, the samadhi of yogis and the rapture of mystics, both highly valued and difficult to achieve voluntarily. A version of Fischer&apos;s graph is shown in Fig. 1.11; the oddly named yogic states [my estimated positions] are described by <a class="fn">Patanjali°.<span>

A bowl-shaped semicircle divided into 13 'altered states of consciousness' (ASCs), with daily life at the bottom, 'mystical rapture' at the top left, and 'samadhi' at the top right.  Above these are Weber's comments: 'Indolent enjoyment of self' at the left, and 'Complacent self-righteousness' at the right. The important aspect is that there are numbers associated with the ASCs: the first, and pretty much only, attempt to move beyond subjective 1st-person characterization of the altered states." />

Fischer&apos;s Axis, which relates 13 verbally described ASCs to instrumental data. This is so far the best quantified brain-activity axis, although the (unquantified) &lsquo;I-Self&rsquo; axis today seems more relevant to religion than the extremes of samadhi and rapture. After <a class="fn">Fischer°.<span>
	Fischer explains the numerical aspects of Fig. 1.11: &lsquo;The numbers 35 to 7 on the perception-hallucination continuum are Goldstein&apos;s coefficient of variation, specifying the decrease in variability of the electroencephalograph (EEG) amplitude with increasing ergotropic arousal. The numbers 26 to 4 on the perception-meditation continuum [refer to EEG frequencies] (measured in hertz) that predominate during, but are not specific to, these states.&rsquo; Both of these are integrated measures of cortical activity detected from outside &mdash; a bit like using climate to describe the weather when we want to know today&apos;s wind and rain.<br>

	This is a hybrid of of Fischer&apos;s 3rd and 4th models. My preference for this combination is its attempt to relate ASCs to meaningful experimental data. The attempt was (and may still be) premature. Magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) and proton-emission tomography (PET) provide new and relevant information, but are expensive and inconvenient, and we still need better experimental tools.

<p>I have added the unquantified &lsquo;I-Self&rsquo; scale at the right, because it seems to me that this is what is happening.
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="NewIdea"></a>
The &lsquo;I&rsquo; is the implied first person of Descarte&apos;s &lsquo;Cogito, ergo sum&rsquo;, who exists as a coherent set of memories of experience. The &lsquo;Self&rsquo; is Hume&apos;s necessary but undiscoverable container and connector of these memories &mdash; which, I argue, is what the new-born arrives with. The connecting scale might best be described as a complex of Kantian networks in brain space, surviving remnants of simultaneous webs of neurochemical, subconscious, emotional, experiential, intellectual data that for some salient reason were worth preserving (by whatever undescribed process), whose sum is all that we can claim of individuality. These exist physically as networks of neural connections, probably directly accessible only from the ASC in which they were formed.
</p>

<p>Fischer&apos;s final version of Fig. 1.11 was circular, with rapture and samadhi closer together. His work has naturally been challenged for overreaching the data, for a lack of intimate familiarity with Eastern metaphysics and Catholic mysticism, and for <a class="fn">premature presentation°.<span>

<p>The white triangle covers the normal range of daily activity, while color covers departures in moments of excitement and tranquility. The more saturated colors are abnormal and seldom reached, so natural selection has had little opportunity to affect them, and there is no guarantee that they are at all useful to us. Cats have a shorter range, from rage to sleep, all useful.

<p id="1C">This diagram is intimately related to religion. An appropriately phrased description of rapture has sometimes earned Catholic sainthood. Muhamad&apos;s revelations came to him in an ASC that presumably bore some relation to Fig. 1.11, as did Saul&apos;s moment on the road to Damascus {Acts 9:3}. Samadhi is the target of meditation &mdash; although Buddhists insist that samadhi merely means concentration,<a class="en" href="#39">C</a> and the target is enlightenment. The difference is a matter of context: Here we are talking about instrumentally distinguishable states. Among people who attempt to quantify ASCs, &lsquo;samadhi&rsquo; seems to be the vernacular name attached to a 3.5 Hz brain-wave freqency &mdash; a state which is reached only rarely. Some practitioners were happy to have achieved what they call samadhi once in a lifetime.

Thus the part played by the oceanic feeling [of mysticism], which might seek something like the restoration of limitless narcissism, is ousted from a place in the foreground.

<p>Arousal of the <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system moves to the left in Fig. 1.9, preparing us for action in its early stages. At the &lsquo;creative&rsquo; stage both sensory input and data processing are maximized. Beyond this, the need for data to process causes the brain to generate its own sensory data, as happens in schizophrenia and sensory-deprivation experiments. &lsquo;At the peak of ecstatic rapture, the outside (physical) world <q>retreats to the fringe of consciousness</q>, and the individual reflects himself in his own <q>program</q>.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Arousal of the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system moves to the right, preparing us for rest and repair. It would be useful to have measures more directly related to location along the continua, such as neurochemical concentrations in specific locations.
</p>

<p>It is characteristic of ASCs that they have their own memory spaces, inaccessible in other states (rather like memory-protection schemes in computers). There may also be frequency-controlled access in which memory states laid down at one dominant EEG frequency are inaccessible at other frequencies.
</p>

<p>The only personal contribution I can offer is that I have dream sequences in which I revisit incredibly complex &lsquo;worlds&rsquo;. So far, 3 of these have left sufficient traces so that I am aware of their existence. It seems that the details go through the hippocampus for permanence, but to a memory store that is not accessible in the waking state. When I revisit a &lsquo;world&rsquo;, I know, for instance, what is inside the large industrial building over there, because I have been in it, even though that knowledge is irrelevant to the current dream. Both the new dream, <i>and its much wider context</i>, are fleetingly accessible in the temporary electrical-memory loop that survives waking. The experience is tantalizing: I want very much to remember the details and reconstruct the plot, but as with Coleridge&apos;s <cite>Xanadu</cite>, observed in a different sort of ASC, the memory is <a class="fn">no longer accessible°.<span>
	It would not surprise me if such memories could be retrieved by hypnosis. If so, there is nothing that would label them as dreams, and one could easily be persuaded by their detailed clarity that they represent some sort of alternate reality.

<p>Both &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;Self&rsquo; have special meanings in Fig. 1.11. The &lsquo;Self&rsquo; is what we arrive with as newborns, knowing nothing of the external world and entirely self-centered. Its needs are cared for, and it has no responsibilities. Life cannot get better than this!
</p>

<p>The &lsquo;I&rsquo; is the image the self gradually creates out of sensory data as it matures. It bumps into things, and constructs a body image so exact that a swollen elbow, protruding a few millimeters beyond the mental image, will repeatedly hit door frames. So too we bump into other selves psychologically, and construct psychological images which minimize emotional bumping.
</p>

<p>States at the same level on the I-Self continuum, share similar properties. At the top of the continuum (all Self), one can apparently &lsquo;rebound&rsquo; from ecstatic rapture to samadhi, and similar transfers from one side to the other have been observed in <a class="fn">cats°.<span>

<p>Another unquantified continuum, which &lsquo;refers to a sense of unification or connection with other things&rsquo;, has been investigated by Andrew Newberg, who divides his time between the Division of Nuclear Medicine and the Religious Studies Department at the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>

<blockquote>An example of some of the important nodal points along this continuum would be the following:<ul><span style="color:green;">
<li>Multiple personality disorder;</li>
<li>No sense of connectedness to anything;</li> <li><b>Baseline reality</b>;</li>
<li>Aesthetic experiences such as the appreciation of a sunset or symphony;</li>
<li>The intense feeling of romantic love in which &lsquo;it&apos;s bigger than both of us&rsquo;;</li>
<li>the numinous experience of reality often through a dream or vision of a divine being or of a mandala;</li>
<li>Cosmic Consciousness &hellip; in which there is a profound sense or &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; of a deep unity underlying discrete reality, but with individual things being perceived as individual;</li>
<li>Various progressively intense trance states during which there is a blurring of the boundaries of individual things;</li>
<li>All the way to the state where there is no perception of spatial or temporal boundaries whatsoever, accompanied by the experience of absolute unity, devoid of content and with even the self-other dichotomy obliterated.</li>

</span></a> is described in most religious traditions (e.g, Lao Tzu: &lsquo;Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe&rsquo;). This state appears very similar to ecstasy/samadhi.
</p>

<p>Discussion of the self/other perception brings us to bilateral brain structures. Except for stereoscopic vision and hearing, we seldom need 2 areas performing the same functions, so left and right areas get different jobs, as shown in Table 1.4. The jobs may change with time as the brain finds better ways to utilize its components. The left hemisphere creates the &lsquo;I&rsquo; of Fig. 1.11, and in split-brain patients (whose hemisphere-linking corpus callosum is cut) the left extremities, controlled by the right hemisphere, often act in opposition to the intentions of the left hemisphere. There are on record people with Multiple Personality Disorder with <a class="fn">70 personalities°.<span>

</span></a> How complex these are, what they share and do not share, and where they reside in the brain, are little understood. At a minimum, they make the concept of &lsquo;self&rsquo; far more fluid than we expect.

A 3-legged cat who has learned to run, will still try to scratch an ear with the stump.

	Bertrand Russell°<span>(1918) <cite>Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays</cite> (Longmans, Green, London).
</span></a> described it, its salient features are those of Table 1.5. He adds:
</p>

<blockquote>The mystic insight begins with the sense	of a mystery unveiled, of a hidden wisdom now suddenly become
certain	beyond the possibility of a doubt. The sense of certainty and revelation comes earlier than any definite belief. &hellip; Even the cautious and patient investigation of	truth by science, which	seems the very antithesis of the mystic&apos;s swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that very spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves. &mdash; {I, p9}.

<p>Where revelation makes contact with the real world in Table 1.5 (quantum theory and spacetime), the original insights may indeed have been revelatory. Yet the 14-decimal-place agreement between experiment and theory has required the reasoned sensing of sophisticated experiments and abstract analysis of theory denied by the first row of Table 1.5. There is a lesson to be heeded here.

<h5><a href="#TOC"> &lsquo;Out-of-body&rsquo; sensation </a></h5>
<a class="trs" href="#25">&#9661;</a>

<p>Perhaps the best known &lsquo;exotic brain event&rsquo; is the out-of-body sensation that accompanies many near-death experiences. Credible people report looking down on their bodies, listening to conversations, remembering events. The natural hypothesis was advanced myriennia ago: &lsquo;the soul&rsquo; &mdash; a form of separable disembodied consciousness &mdash; has left the body, observed it from afar, and returned to it, thus explaining &lsquo;everything&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>The soul has been a reasonable hypothesis for most of history. It is our growing awareness of the complexity of the brain that brings doubt. Long ago philosophers asked how the soul connects to the body. Today, as our machines get smarter, we ask how the soul might function without its hardware. Unplug a computer&apos;s memory, and it doesn&apos;t work very well. We now realize that the hypothesis of a separable consciousness, devoid of material accoutrements, capable of carrying personality onward is an incredibly complicated explanation, implying an undetectable supporting structure as complex as the physical world itself.
</p>

<p>Religions, accepting magical thinking, have found the soul-hypothesis simple and satisfying. Comforting
it may be, but its corollaries are dauntingly complex and completely unsupported. Don&apos;t get me wrong here: If it were my universe, I would keep tinkering with it until social justice prevailed. (Even 6-year-olds have a well developed sense of fairness: why should the universe have less?) The problem is that the known laws of our universe let us get from what looks like empty space to galaxies and self-aware matter (us) without needing any sort of supernatural support. (Why this should be possible is the question that needs the attention we pay to the just-so stories of mainstream religions!)
</p>

<p>The problem is complexity. The soul <i>is not a simple concept!</i> Quantum field theory, which works by processes we  do not understand but can manipulate, is <i>simpler</i> than supernaturalism, which we cannot even manipulate.
</p>

<p>Given this impasse, a simpler explanation of out-of-body experiences is available: they arise from 2 known psychological phenomena.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the absence of sensory input, nothing compels our sense of self to remain attached to the body, so that in ASCs we are free to detach our point of view from it.</li>

<li>A general phenomenon of reduced cortical arousal retaining some level of awareness occurs with both <a class="fn">meditation°<span>
	R Jevning, RK Wallace, M Beidenbach (1992) &lsquo;The physiology of meditation: A review. A wakeful hypnometabolic integrated response&rsquo; <cite>Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews</cite> <b>16</b>: 415-424.
</span></a> and <a class="fn">anesthesia°.<span>
	W Penfield (1975) <cite>The Mystery of the Mind</cite> (Princeton: Princeton University Press)
</span></a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a particular anesthetic leaves a particular brain conscious and feeling pain, but paralyzed and unable to convey this fact. Vision and hearing may not be completely blocked. With portions of the brain shut down, the remainder does the best it can.
</p>

<p>All reports of &lsquo;after-death&rsquo; experience may be intepreted in this manner, as a plausible reconstruction of events while the cortex was flat-lined but the interior of the brain still active. Occam&apos;s Razor suggests that this is a far more economical hypothesis.

The alternative requires fitting a &lsquo;soul&rsquo; into the gaps of what we know. This introduces a suite of unanswerable questions, including what it might be made of, what sensors it experiences the world with, how it stores memory, and how it interacts with matter &mdash; questions which have long puzzled philosophers, but are seldom asked by supernaturalists.

<p>Mystics and prophets believe that revelations are external events. Joan of Arc was sure that archangels <a class="fn">spoke to her°.<span>
	A little known historical fact suggests that she did <i>not</i> hear archangels. When the English burned her at the stake, her heart did not burn. This has been interpreted as a result of calcification by tuberculosis, which also infects the brain. &lsquo;A common sequel of a cerebral tuberculoma is temporal lobe epilepsy [with accompanying hallucinated voices], and there we have the hallucinations that changed history&rsquo;.

</p>

<p>Muhamad wondered whether Gabriel or Satan or a djinn was talking to him; his family preferred &lsquo;Gabriel&rsquo; &mdash; and that was the extent of the verification! Supernaturalists ask by what right outsiders question the interpretation of those to whom such experiences are given: the answer is &lsquo;Ockham&apos;s Razor&rsquo; &mdash; but brain researcher Rhawn Joseph demurs:
</p>

<blockquote>[T]here is a scientific, neurological, and genetic foundation for religious belief, spirituality, and paranormal phenomenon, including the experience of gods, demons, spirits, souls, and life after death. &hellip; There are specific regions of the brain, the limbic system, <strike>which serves as a transmitter to God,</strike> which become highly active when dreaming, during trance states, meditation, prayer, or under LSD &hellip;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>[These regions] enable us to experience
<strike>those realms of reality normally filtered from consciousness, including the reality</strike>
[all that we know] of god, the spirit, the soul, and life after death &mdash; <a class="fn">
	R Joseph (2002)°<span> <cite>The Transmitter To God</cite> (University Press, San Jose CA): 7.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">This statement appeared with the struck-out passages, which are unsupported conjectures. Before one can speak meaningfully of &lsquo;transmission&rsquo;, one must be able to detect (if not interpret) a signal. This has not been done. A more cautious researcher would have limited himself to the bracketed alternative words, which are unexceptionably factual. Joseph&apos;s defence is, &lsquo;You don&apos;t develop a brain structure to help you experience something that doesn&apos;t exist&rsquo;. This may be true, but Joseph&apos;s &lsquo;realities&rsquo; are idiosyncratic <i>interpretations</i> of events whose mundane explanation must wait until Ch. 4.
</p>

<p>We know that LSD works only with <a class="fn">available information°.<span>
	Such, at least, is my conclusion. LSD scanned my memories, collecting everything I knew about &lsquo;the evocative hand&rsquo; (e.g.: the musical conductor, the saluting soldier, the praying hands, the pointing finger, the helpless palms, the face palm, the lover's touch, the death-defying grip of a new-born, &hellip;) and cross-filed it under this new rubric. It did not add basic instances (e.g., the handclasp of a dying friend, &hellip;) that I had not yet experienced. <br><br>
	The marvelous pyrotechnic visual displays that LSD produces can sometimes be seen during hypnopompic states also.
</span></a> A process mimic&apos;d by LSD works under the same restrictions, suggesting that revelation also works with what it finds in the brain: Catholics and Protestants, Native Americans and Zen Buddhists, Hindus and Sufis, receive only revelations that are compatible with (and generally predictable from) their pre-existing beliefs.
</p>

<p>Mental events occurring at the Self end of neurological continua make a great impression on the brain (just as they do on the infant brain). Experiments with psilocybin at The Johns Hopkins University found that it produced &lsquo;feelings of unity with all things, transcendence of time and space, deep and abiding joy&rsquo; in 22 out of 36 middle-aged volunteers. In follow-up interviews 14 rated the experience as among the <a class="fn">most meaningful of their lives°.<span>

<p>Michael Persinger, professor of neuroscience at Ontario&apos;s Laurentia University, stimulated the temporal lobe with induced electrical current with his &lsquo;God helmet&rsquo; &mdash; and most subjects described religious experiences which were indistinguishable from those <a class="fn">reported by mystics°.<span>
	MA Persinger (1983) &lsquo;Religious and mystical experiences as artifacts of temporal lobe function: a general hypothesis&rsquo; <cite>Perceptual and Motor Skills</cite> <b>57</b>: 1255&ndash;1262.
</span></a> 80% reported another presence in the room; 1% &lsquo;experienced god&rsquo;. The ones who did not respond &mdash; Richard Dawkins among them (and, guessing, myself) &mdash; are likely to measure low on psychological tests of suggestibility.
</p>

<p>Persinger’s work has been <a class="fn">criticized°<span>
	P Granqvist &amp;6a (2005) &lsquo;Sensed presence and mystical experiences are predicted by suggestibility, not by the application of transcranial weak complex magnetic fields&rsquo; <cite>Neurosci Lett.</cite> <b>379</b>(#1): 1-6.
</span></a> on both instrumental and design grounds. The magnetic fields were 6 orders of magnitude weaker than customary transcranial fields. A double-blind replication (with neither subject nor observer knowing when the machine was switched on) yielded no reproducible results. Evidently all that Persinger showed was that 80% of the population was highly suggestible to religious concepts. This in itself is interesting, if not alarming.
</p>

<p>One point that Persinger makes is that a &lsquo;flat-line&rsquo; EEG is <i>not</i> a signal of death; it merely indicates that there is no activity in the outer 5 mm of the cortex. People in comas, in whom only the brainstem is active, can live in such a &lsquo;vegetative state&rsquo; for years &mdash; and may then (inexplicably) recover. An EEG does not respond to limbic activity, whose electrical field is shielded by the thickness of the cortex. How much <i>emotional</i> activity is occurring in a particular flat-lined brain is a wide-open question. &lsquo;Near-death&rsquo; experiences come from an active limbos subjected to unusual stresses such as reduced blood flow or low oxygen from surgical procedures, with little or no sensory data or cortical input. The limbos does the best it can in this situation, which it surely interprets as <a class="fn">seriously abnormal°.<span>

<p>Another curious phenomenon is known as binaural beating, in which each ear is fed a different dominant audio frequency, perhaps accompanied with pink noise, natural sounds, or music.

<p>As an indication of how little we understand the brain, it is useful to review some well attested experiments. The process of learning is accompanied by the formation of new synapses, yet memory is not localized, and seems to be distributed holographically over the cortex. Holograms imply <b>Fourier transforms</b> of information between time and frequency domains, which the brain uses for processing both sound and sight, and which are fast in dedicated hardware. Any small bit of a visual hologram can reproduce the whole image (more hologram increases resolution), and 3-D optical holograms can store multiple images in different orientations. It is easier to see how the brain might do Fourier transforms, than to imagine how it stores holograms. Something complex is going on, because stimulating a particular spot may evoke a specific memory &mdash; but restimulating it moment later will evoke a different memory.

We cannot ethically experiment in this area except as nature offers subjects, so little has been learned in the 40 years since Lorber&apos;s report. These cases suggest that the brain is an incredibly flexible device, and that it has barely begun to understand how to use itself.

<p>The naturalistic hypothesis &mdash; that religious experiences are entirely internal and do not depend upon external input &mdash; is simple, testable and compatible with known neural behavior. It is unpersuasive to supernaturalists, who dismiss experiment as &lsquo;interference&rsquo; and deny that evoked religious experiences are relevant to &lsquo;real&rsquo; religious experiences. Further progress requires experiments during an accepted religious experience. If (for instance) we were dealing with divine electromagnetism, a Faraday cage and magnetic shield would block the signal. External input to an on-going religious experiences could be switched on and off at will, unbeknownst to the prophet.
</p>

<p>True Believers will object that electromagnetism is not necessarily the way gods choose to communicate. Perhaps not &mdash; but if there is communication, there <i>must</i> be a method. If the &lsquo;god signal&rsquo; is detectable by the human brain, it is detectable (even if not interpretable) by other physical devices. Table 1.7 summarizes the modalities so far proposed to explain how religious experiences are received or occur. We will look at communication theory a bit more in Ch. 4, but for now we note that the only alternative to electromagnetism or psychoactive drugs that has been suggested as a stimulus for revelation is Mohammed&apos;s. As the recent history of Catholic priests demonstrates, <a class="fn">pedophilia°<span>

<p>Brain abilities evolve to solve specific problems.

<p>I regret not analyzing as it was happening the only personal experience that might be related to these exotic phenomena. In the heady aftermath of <a class="fn">young love°,<span>
	Since it might be relevant, I mention that we had twice answered the 567 questions of the cross-MMPI questionnaire, which when reduced to the standard graph and superimposed, showed a single line instead of the usual 4. Dr Paul Popenoe said that in 30 years of counseling, he had never seen anything like this: &lsquo;If you two can&apos;t make it, no one can!&rsquo; So much for questionnaires!
</span></a> our forearms were lying side by side, and I was idly stroking hers. Or mine. The odd thing was that I could not tell, without looking, whose arm I was <a class="fn">touching°.<span>
	I was 28 at the time, old enough so that I should have been scientifically interested in the phenomenon, which proved to be unique. However, QBD implies that intentional brain activity affects functional brain behavior, and I was <i>not</i> going to interfere with the experience. Nor can I ask her about it now: we, alas, lost touch long ago.
	
	Perhaps I should add a measure of involvement. One day on another continent I stuck an unplayed CD in my Macintosh while I wrote (about air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> partitioning). Suddenly, for no discernable reason, I found myself waltzing around the room with an imaginary partner, dodging furniture and scattering cats, with tears streaming down my face.
	
	&lsquo;What&rsquo;, I asked myself when the music ended, &lsquo;was <i>that</i> all about?&rsquo; The CD track meant nothing to me &mdash; New Lost City Ramblers playing Woody's &lsquo;Cowboy Waltz&rsquo;. Never heard of it.

	Then there were intimations of related fragments &mdash; a blouse in green and black on white, no bra &mdash; and the first time I danced with her, 45 years gone by, with a wife and a couple of decadal relationships in between.
	
</span></a> The sensory signal returned <i>from the arm</i> was <a class="fn">identical°.<span>
	Correspondents tell me that this odd sensations is not unique, and that they too have experienced it in similar situations.
	


	
</span></a> The closest analog I can think of is what happens the first few times you cross your fingers and stroke your nose: the naïve brain interprets this as stroking the adjacent sides of a pair of noses 2 finger-widths apart. In that case, there are physical signals to interpret; the confusion lies in not integrating kinesthetic information about the position of the fingers. I was incurious about the arms because at the time the effect seemed perfectly natural. I did comment on it, but all she said was, &lsquo;I know&rsquo;. Was she feeling the same thing?

<p>Austin&apos;s <a class="fn">professional analysis°<span>
	J Austin (1998) <cite>Zen and the Brain</cite> (MIT Press, Cambridge MA).
</span></a> of his experience was that cortical functions were damped, including time-passage in the frontal lobe, self-awareness in the temporal lobes, spacial orientation and self/other discrimination in the parietal lobes, and fear generation in the amygdalae. His mystical experience did not &lsquo;reach higher levels of awareness&rsquo;: it shut down <a class="fn">large parts of his brain°.<span>

</p>

<p>If so, we have a different interpretation of the mystic&apos;s &lsquo;unity of all things&rsquo;: the brain has simply lost its ability to distinguish between self and environment. This does not tell us anything about &lsquo;reality&rsquo; that we didn&apos;t know as a newborn.

</span></a> neuroanatomist, woke up one morning with a stroke in the process of shutting down her left hemisphere. It is directly relevant to our discussion, since the left hemisphere contains the &lsquo;I&rsquo; personality. A few of her descriptions of life without this persona include the joy of being &lsquo;entirely disconnected from brainchatter&rsquo;, with &lsquo;37 years of emotional baggage&rsquo; <i>gone</i>. These appear to be similar to the goals of samadhi, as &lsquo;her consciousness shifted into present-moment thinking whereby she experienced herself <q>at one with the universe</q>&rsquo;. &lsquo;Wow! This is cool! How many brain researchers have been able to watch a stroke from the inside?&rsquo; &lsquo;Euphoria! Euphoria!&rsquo; &lsquo;Nirvana! I found nirvana!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>The opportunity to do better focussed investigation occurs (so far) only with open-brain conscious-patient surgery, which requires close cooperation between a brain surgeon and the researcher. Even with a patient whose temporal lobe is exposed, time is limited; there are few markers on the brain to suggest where to stimulate; it is impossible to know everything about the patient&apos;s prior information (conscious and unconscious) &mdash; so the process is a matter of trial and error. Still, I implore any brain surgeon reading this to find a colleague (like Oliver Sacks) interested in temporal/parietal-lobe functions, and give her as much opportunity to poke around as is consistent with the patient&apos;s welfare.
</p>

<p>Reliable hard data is limited, but we can safely say the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a physical correlate to religious experience: Particular areas light up in brain scans during such an experience;</li>

<li>Neurotransmitters are involved: serotonin-mimic LSD lights the same areas;</li>

<li>Stimulating these areas causes people to report religious experiences.</li>

<li>The stimulus for induced experience carries no information, so all subjective material originates in the brain. Descriptions do not differ from those reported by accepted religious mystics, and are sect-specific.</li>

<li>Unsuspecting non-mystical individuals can have such experiences.</li>

<li>Shown patterns masked by noise, believers see them more easily than sceptics.</li>
</ul>


<p class="flu">(The last finding is problematical for scientists, because quotidian research requires hard-nosed scepticism, while Nobel Prizes often spring from intuitive insights.)

<p>One can anticipate a research tool which might help resolve some of these questions. Consider a permanently installed version of Persinger&apos;s helmet, consisting of a flexible membrane covered with electronic devices at the spatial resolution of Apple&apos;s &lsquo;Retina&rsquo; display, capable of emitting an appropriate signal, under precise computer control. Three signal modalities seem possible: electrostatic from small capacitors, electrical current from point emitters, and magnetic field from tiny solenoids. Such devices would represent an immense gain in areal resolution, but a corresponding loss of depth penetration.
</p>

<p>The mechanics look doable. Ethically one might expect the traditional approach in which the doctor tries the procedure on himself. Given our apparent inability to refuse to do anything we are technically capable of, I should think that results from small versions might appear within <a class="fn">a few years°.<span>

<p>Similar tools for investigating the limbos are an order of magnitude more difficult, electronically, physically, and medically. The superficial, cortical electronic patch looks to be straightforward extrapolation of existing techniques, almost the sort of thing one might find in the App Store next year.

<p>It has perhaps not escaped the reader that several neurological continua seem to lead to similar &lsquo;Self&rsquo; states. This is a hypothesis which has not been tested, but which is consistent with reports by mystics and scientists alike &mdash; and it can be falsified instrumentally. This follows if the &lsquo;Self&rsquo; is the bare-bones genetically determined functioning of the various components of the brain, and the &lsquo;I&rsquo; is their integrated time-and-experience functioning. Ockham&apos;s Razor then suggests that the return to the &lsquo;Self&rsquo; merely represents a <i>loss of contact</i> with everything that distinguishes the &lsquo;I&rsquo;. One sheds awareness of all that he has learned or done, and returns temporarily to the perception of pure Self &mdash; in short, a &lsquo;good trip&rsquo; goes back to the womb.  We do, after all, carry this with us, deeply buried: The &lsquo;bad-trip&rsquo; version is any psychological stress that induces the fetal position. Perhaps this idea needs expansion. Psychiatrists concerned with entirely different responses have observed that psychotic and &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; patients &mdash; the latter having both schizophrenic and neurotic features &mdash; &lsquo;display behavior that is <a  class="fn" href="http://violenceandreligion.com/about-covr/">similar to the toddler&rsquo;°,<span>

We parents are the laboratory rats&rsquo;, says Alison Gopnik. Having said that, the newborn&apos;s ability to <i>interpret</i> unfamiliar sensory input is nearly non-existent, so it gets filtered out. The adult in samadhi is likewise bereft of meaningful sensory input, and aware only of his own &lsquo;self-referential nature&rsquo;. Yet the adult (unlike the infant) is subliminally aware that there is a whole universe &lsquo;out there&rsquo;. Lacking sensory input to distinguish &lsquo;in&rsquo; from &lsquo;out&rsquo;, the idea that &lsquo;Atman is Brahman&rsquo; &mdash; the Self is the Absolute &mdash; is a rational conclusion.

</p>

<p>The alternative, less self-congratulatory, view is that the philosophically unacceptable egoism of the newborn is reinterpreted by an adult brain as philosophically desirable universal unity. An interesting feature supporting this idea is that EEG waves in the δ band of samadhi, below 4 Hz, are also characteristic of babies (and also of deep sleep). This makes good sense: the less a brain has to do, less bandwidth it needs, and the lower the frequency it can use, just as for silicon. Apparently no one has looked for meditation analogs in the brain waves of cats, but as a guess, a purring cat, kneading gently with her front paws in a return to the activity of a nursing kitten, is another analog of human samadhi: slow brain waves; utter peace; absolute contentment.

</span></a> at the University of Pennsylvania, has MRI images of experienced meditators during intense spiritual peaks, which show dramatic reduction of blood flow to the orientation-association area of the left parietal lobe. In Table 1.4 the left parietal was described as being responsible for the sense of a physical body. Shut it down, and one&apos;s sense of Self is no longer localized by a stream of sensory data.
</p>

<p>It appears that <a href="http://psychedelicfrontier.com/how-psilocybin-works-addition-by-subtraction/">reducing blood flow</a> to particular brain areas produces altered states of consciousness that are interpreted as desirable spiritual experiences. In such states one is vulnerable to real-world damage, so natural selection has done its best to guarantee constant flow. It takes years of practice to change it at will, an effort that has contributed to the impression of desirability.
</p>

<p>If slowing blood flow were the result of a medical procedure, the patient would be told not to worry about the associated transient feelings of dissociation. If it could be taught in a week (perhaps with biofeedback), or if it were as easy to achieve as a high from cannabis, we would legislate against meditation and lecture teenagers about the danger of permanent damage to the brain.
</p>

<p>My tame shaman points out that I am assuming that shutting down the cortex is all that happens during meditation. I plead guilty, because that is the simplest hypothesis that explains the data:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li>Shut down the reptilian brain, and death ensues. But the reptilian brain does not handle emotional or verbal processes, so no events here seem likely to contribute significantly to meditational experience. Recollections after recovery from a coma have been interpreted as <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/A-Near-Death-Experience-Reflection-Coincidences-are-Proof-of-Him"> &lsquo;revelatory insights&rsquo;</a>, but such reports are subjective experiences of True Believers.</li>

<li>Rhawn Joseph suggests the limbos as the site of revelatory activity. The advantage is that the limbos is little understood. The disadvantage is that it is divided into <a href="#F1.3">discrete components</a> whose purposes <i>will</i> ultimately be described <a class="fn">in detail°.<span>
	If we were dealing with a computer, the limbos would be its collection of low-level device drivers.
</span></a> (Only the thalamus appears to integrate.) Tampering with the limbos will affect emotions in unpredictable ways, but since the limbos is as non-verbal as a musk-ox, once again, new limbic experiences will be cortically interpreted according to an existing belief system.</li>

<li>Shutting down the cortex is not life threatening. Partial shut downs can account for most meditational experiences, and bicamerality can account for auditory events.</li>

<li>Okham&apos;s Razor suggests that cortical shutdown explains enough about meditation so that nothing else is needed until there is quantitative data that does not fit this hypothesis.</li>
</ul>


<p>It may seem egotistical for a sceptical scientist to dismiss 4000 years of interpretation by millions of earnest truth-seekers &mdash; with semi-divine teachers among them! But is it not also a little egotistical to assume that one has, by sitting still and doing as little thinking as possible, discovered the secrets of the universe?

<p class="epi">My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that, and I intend to end up there. &mdash; Jalal al-Din Rumi, Sufi philosopher, 1207&ndash;1273.
</p>

<p>In discussions with Buddhist friends, it occurred to me that although sleep usually pre-empts my approach to meditation (as it often does for novice Zen monks), yet I knew one aspect of samadhi from a recurring childhood dream. Every time I had a fever (and was thus in a reproducible ASC) until I was about 6, I had the same vivid, but totally non-verbal dream, largely kinesthetic, and so difficult to describe that I did not mention it until I was in my teens, and then to an engineer friend, who immediately said that he had had the same dream. He interpreted it as a birth memory, and as soon as he said that, all the pieces clicked into place and I saw it as a <a class="fn">coherent memory°.<span>
	This suggests that one runs a fever while being born &mdash; not an unlikely consequence of the process, and testable, but one that would naturally leave any memory of it normally inaccessible.<br>
	For what it is worth, Ray Bradbury also remembered being born. Perhaps the memory is more common than we thought.
</span></a> </p>

<aside style="font-family:'Palatino', Georgia, Serif;">

<p> In the dream, there was no time, no responsibility, nothing that needed doing (not even breathing). There was comfort, and &lsquo;the peace that passeth understanding&rsquo;. Above all, there was contentment. (85 years later, I did not write &lsquo;I was contented&rsquo; &mdash; because there was no &lsquo;I&rsquo; at this point. This is the &lsquo;Self&rsquo; state, hardly conscious because there was nothing but contentment to be aware of.) Simultaneously supremely egoistic and at one with the then known universe, all was well. Nothing needed change, nothing needed improvement, then or ever. Time did not exist because all needs were cared for and all wishes granted before awareness of them. (A remotely comparable satisfaction might be some combination of relaxation after a monumental task well done plus post-coital lassitude.)
</p>

<p>Suddenly, for no reason at all, this bliss, this idyll, was destroyed by the most horrible change and terrifying wrongness. No pain. Torsion, compression, distortion, loss, helplessness &mdash; and <i>wrong, <b>wrong, WRONG!</b></i>&nbsp;  I &mdash; and now, for the first time, there was an &lsquo;I&rsquo; &mdash; was cut adrift from the Universe. Terrible things were happening that I had no control over. I was totally defenseless in the face of absolute catastrophe.
</p>

<p class="cen">No wonder newborns cry!
</p>
<br><hr>

<p>When my daughter was born, umbilical cord tied and cut, and laid face down on the bed, I remembered &mdash; and stroked her back. A feeble attempt, perhaps, but what other way to send a message? And it worked: almost as though startled out of crying, she relaxed, perhaps thinking, &lsquo;Oh? New! Nice! Not disaster after all?&rsquo; &mdash; and with a big sigh, went to sleep, after the hardest and most <a class="fn">terrifying day°<span>
	Otto Rank made the birth experience central to his psychoanalytic theory. It&apos;s probably a good idea to let newborns know they&apos;re appreciated as soon as possible. See
	O Rank (1924) <cite>The Trauma of Birth</cite> (Brunner, NYC, 1952).
</span></a> of her life.
</p>

</aside>

<p>Years later, when I described this dream to my shrink, he pooh-poohed the idea of a birth memory and suggested alternatives from familiar events of childhood &mdash; none of which came close to fitting. I had mentioned something about a sailboat in a gentle breeze; he suggested visual references &mdash; but mine was purely kinesthetic. I had said something about meat grinders and spaghetti sauce, but these were efforts to find analogs for the torsion, compression, and marginally visual aspects. It occurs to me as I write, that perhaps my &lsquo;instinctive&rsquo; aversion to eating meat was an association between the intense wrongness and the &lsquo;meat-grinder/spaghetti-sauce&rsquo; aspects of the <a class="fn">experience°,<span>
	What a comedown that would be! I have always rather supposed that I had acquired just enough merit in previous lives so that now the question of eating sentient fellow travellers on the journey of life was a simple non-starter. We know so little about how the universe works that perhaps both interpretations are true.
</span></a> although this is certainly not a universal response. In any case, my first major disillusionment with the human race &mdash; probably when I was about 2½ years old &mdash; was accompanied by a similar horrible feeling of wrongness (Who <i>are</i> these people? Had I gotten off at the <a class="fn">wrong planet?°)<span>
	Obviously, this expression is an adult attempt to describe the childhood feeling of utter misplacement, for which there was then no suitable vocabulary. The vocabulary would have to wait another 2½ years, until I met Buck Rogers in the Sunday paper.
</span></a> and awareness that I was trapped in a place I didn&apos;t belong. It came when my mother explained that people really did eat animals here: Robinson Crusoe shared some of my horror when he saw footprints in the sand and realized that his island was visited by cannibals.

<h5><a href="#TOC"> Samadhi: infantile and adult </a></h5>
<a class="trs" href="#39">&#9661;</a>

<p>The blissful stage of the dream seems to be very similar to published descriptions of samadhi. The similarity is strong enough to call into question all mystical discourse. Max Weber, judging by his sarcastic descriptions of rapture and samadhi (in the upper corners of <a href="#F1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>), arrived at a similar conclusion &mdash; without calling attention to its infantile connection. (He did, after all, have his Oxford professorship to protect.) If this conclusion is correct, human adepts have devoted tremendous efforts to reducing themselves to infancy, in the hope of enjoying an experience which in the final analysis is pure narcissism. This casts an entirely literal light on Jesus&apos;s comment, &lsquo;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein&rsquo; {Luke 18:17}.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the experience of universal unity leaves behind:
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im" src="../images/K-TakeHome3.gif" alt="TakeHome"></a>
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li>an abiding ecological empathy with the world;</li>
<li>a burning desire to protect nature from the depredations of overpopulation and greed;</li>
<li>an incandescent rage at <a class="fn" href="../_F/F23.shtml#08">economic inequality;°<span>
	There is &lsquo;natural&rsquo; economic inequality, with a range similar to the range of other human endowments, and there is &lsquo;unnatural&rsquo; economic inequality of the sort beloved by CEOs and bankers, imposed by manipulation, and possessing no upper limit.
</span></a> </li>

<li>and a fierce determination to devote one&apos;s life to Eirenic and Gaian ends;</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">it is useful indeed. Yet this is a rare consequence, and 4 millennia of pursuit of samadhi in Asia have seldom achieved it. &lsquo;That&apos;s not the <i>goal</i>!&rsquo; say quietist Buddhists &mdash; making my point for me. It <i>should be</i> the goal.
</p>

<p>There is a good reason why such insight is difficult to attain by natural means. Once you see the connection of all things, you are &mdash; by cortical logic, limbic emotion, and spiritual unity &mdash; as responsible for them as you are for yourself. Synthetic kinship expands to include all of creation. Few people are ready for this level of commitment, so the tendency is to rationalize away the logic, dismiss the emotion, etherialize the unity, and accept the altered state of consciousness itself as the be-all and end-all of the experience. This avoidance of adult responsibility, seeking infantile samadhi for its own sake, is a form of spiritual masturbation, indulgent and unproductive.
</p>

<p>Because there is no known way to distinguish, by measurements or from descriptions, the condition of the newborn from the condition of the mystic and yogi, and because their historical influence on the real world are identically nil, <b>samadhi and rapture alike appear to be exceedingly complicated replacements for thumb-sucking</b>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Mediterranean mystery religions sought</p>

<blockquote>to induce in the candidate a special kind of experience which would leave him with a conviction of the reality of postmortem existence and which <b>also seems to have induced a sense of the kinship of all life</b>, [&hellip;employing] hypnosis, flagellation, fasting, whirling dances, the inhalation of fumes, the contemplation of sacred objects, [and] special music &hellip; singly and in combination &mdash; <a class="fn">
	G.R. Taylor (1954)°,<span><cite>Sex in History</cite> (Thames &amp; Hudson, London): Ch. 12}
</span></a> emphasis added.
</blockquote>

<p>A logical point seldom made is that the conviction that &lsquo;The Self does not exist&rsquo; is identical to the conviction that &lsquo;The Self is all there is&rsquo;. There is only a single &lsquo;thing&rsquo; to be aware of; its name is arbitrary. &lsquo;Ātman is Brāhman; Anātman is Brāhman&rsquo;. What happens when you reach this state depends on where you came from. Let a devotee of Instinct-1 come to this and you have a megalomaniac who <i>knows</i> he is god incarnate: &lsquo;When the President does it, it isn&apos;t illegal&rsquo;!</p>

<p>It is time for one of Gautama&apos;s own parables. In the <cite>Majjhima-Nikaya</cite> 22.113, a man on a journey builds a raft to cross a riotous whitewater river. After he reaches the other side, he is so impressed by the utility of the cumbersome raft that he straps it on his back and carries it through the forest, where it constantly impedes him by snagging on branches. Buddhism, said Buddha, is like the raft; essential for one part of the journey. So too is this business of samadhi &mdash; as well as the whole concept of religion.	&emsp;

<p class="epi">Wisdom may involve optimal balance between functions of phylogenetically more primitive brain regions (limbic system) and newer ones (prefrontal cortex). &mdash; <a class="fn">
	TW Meeks, DV Jeste (2009)°<span>&lsquo;Neurobiology of Wisdom: A Literature Overview&rsquo; <cite>Archives of General Psychiatry</cite> <b>66</b>(#4): 355&ndash;365; doi: 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.8

<p>Politicians, economists, and the media harp on the dangers of an aging population: a declining work force, an increasing need for medical services, unemployment, a failing Social Security system, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta. Aside from its sloppy logic, this is a highly warped point of view.
</p>

<p>The logic? We cannot have a declining work force (too few workers) <i>and</i> unemployment (too many workers) simultaneously, unless there is serious intentional distortion of both political language and the labor market.
</p>

<p>The warp? This interpretation arises because &mdash; and only because &mdash; in the employers&rsquo; view there are too few in the country who are willing to work 3rd-world hours, in 3rd-world conditions, for 3rd-world pay. This is a consequence of free trade between grossly imbalanced economies. We lose unions, jobs, civilized working conditions, the potential 30-hour work week, the living wage. In return, we get cheap clothes and toys &mdash; and an Army that is prepared to shoot anyone who objects. Our elected representatives made this choice for us, at the behest of their (and our) employers. A rational country would immediately impeach any President who ordered his armed forces to fire on striking workers just because his campaign contributors told him to. (If anyone in the system needs being fired on, it is those contributors!) A rational country would impeach any President whose FBI &lsquo;treated the Occupy movement as a potential criminal and terrorist threat, [and functioned] as a de facto intelligence arm of Wall Street and Corporate America&rsquo;, as Obama&apos;s did. This is not incipient fascism; this is full-fledged, <a class="fn">working fascism°.<span>
	Another example: On 2012-06-26, long-time peace activists Sister Megan Rice, 82, Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, and Michael Walli, 63, cut through 4 fences to trespass on the Oak Ridge Y-12 nuclear-weapons production facility, where they hung up peace banners, spray-painted peace slogans, and sang peace songs while waiting for security people to notice and arrest them.<br>
	A proportional punishment would have had them pay to repair the fences.<br>
	By 2012-10-04 US Attorney General Eric Holder had replaced a tresspassing charge with sabotage, obstruction of national defence, and willful damage of national security property, for a possible 35 years in prison.<br>
	What did Obama fear so deeply that it led him to appoint a mentally unbalanced Attorney General?
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Another view suggests that we spend a third of our lives in a primarily limbic mode, while the cortex is still getting organized. Dependent first on our parents, then interested primarily in sexual partners, then bringing up children, and learning all the time, we reach 30 with a well practiced limbic system and a functioning cortex. With reproduction out of the way, the limbos can subside, and we have a third of a lifetime that is primarily cortical. Still learning, we accumulate work experience, observe political and social experiments, and learn critical evaluation. By 60, the brain&apos;s components are well stocked with a lifetime&apos;s experience, both limbic and cortical, and we have another 30 years to think about it, integrate what we have experienced, and with luck arrive at that rare condition known as &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;, in which the colored arrows of <a href="#F1.10">Fig. 1.10</a> swing together and the brain&apos;s incompatible approaches can work in harmony.
</p>

<p>In the rational world of, say, 40 years ago (see <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#F23.1">Fig. 23.1</a>), an aging work force might have been seen as an advantage. Age may not guarantee wisdom, but wisdom and youth seldom go hand in hand.
</p>

<p><a class="fn">
	Meeks &amp; Jeste°<span>(2009) &lsquo;Neurobiology of Wisdom: A Literature Overview&rsquo; <cite>Archives of General Psychiatry</cite> <b>66</b>(#4): 355&ndash;365; doi: 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.8
</span></a> suggest 6 components of wisdom, which we paraphrase a bit:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li>Altruism</li>
<li>Empathy and social skill</li>
<li>Emotional balance</li>
<li>Introspection and self-knowledge</li>
<li>Tolerance</li>
<li>Ability to cope with uncertainty and ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">Note how little Instinct-1 contributes, and how long it may take to acquire and integrate the components!
</p>

<p>If one were to propose a &lsquo;mechanism for wisdom&rsquo;, it would, I think, be based on the established facts that (1) we lose neurons over time, but (2) the surviving neurons gain synapses. The physical aspect might be seen as correlating with the mental aspect: knowledge is transferred from the removed neuron to the burgeoning interconnections &mdash; and in the process is integrated into a larger and more connected system. One thing known to contribute to the retention of synapse formation is use of the system. The brain is like any other organ: use it or lose it. The synapses of a couch potato are as flabby as his muscles.
</p>

<p>Granted, most of us mess up along the way. In some, synapse formation falters and learning stops. In others, limbic catastrophes subvert cortical development. Too often, the alpha male&apos;s belief that peons should work 24/7 for their betters interferes &mdash; in the peon for lack of time to reflect; in the alpha from sheer egoism. We stumble into one or more of the 4 great life-shorteners: poor diet, lack of exercize, smoking, and obesity. All of these deflect us from life&apos;s principal project &mdash; for, as Socrates observed, &lsquo;the unexamined life [in which one cannot acquire wisdom] is not worth living&rsquo;.

&lsquo;[T]he classifications of technical terms &hellip; has received its highest development &hellip; in the Buddhist philosophy.

</span></a>
</p>

<p>In addition to its definition as <i>concentration</i>, samadhi is variously defined as <a class="fn">&lsquo;the Noble Trance&rsquo;°,<span>
	AJ Edmunds (2001) &lsquo;Buddha&apos;s Discourse on the End of the World&rsquo; <cite>The Open Court</cite> <b>15</b>(#7): 428&ndash;432.

<br>---------------<br>
	Oddly, Edkin&apos;s note is intended to explain Buddha&apos;s words to Ananda: &lsquo;There is a samadhi called that of the <cite>Sheu-leng-yen Rajah</cite> &hellip;. It embraces all good actions, and describes how all the Buddhas were rescued from the world of sense and entered the glorious path that leads to confirmed rest&rsquo;, suggesting that samadhis shared some properties of stories or texts.
</span></a> occurring to Buddha or his disciples when engaged in deep contemplation, and in which an impression or vision teaching certain religious dogmas seems present to the mind&apos;s eye&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>In a wider context, terminology for meditational ASCs is fraught with controversy and 4-dimensional confusion. The dimensions of this ill defined terrain are:
</p>

<p>(1) <b>Traditions</b>. Each language has its own specialized vocabulary. Chinese <i>Chan</i>, Hindu <i>Dhyana</i>, Japanese <i>Zen</i>, Korean <i>Seon</i>, Pali <a class="fn"><i>Jhana</i>°,<span>
	EJ Thomas (1914) <cite>The Life of Buddha as Legend and History</cite> (3rd ed) (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1975) Ch. 6 &amp; 13.
</span></a> Sufi (Arabic) <i>Muraqaba</i>, Tibetan <i>Samten</i> and Vietnamese <i>Thien</i> all refer to meditation and its many ASCs, but they do not necessarily describe identical concepts. We haven&apos;t even mentioned shamanism, which includes the myriad orally transmitted traditions of 1000 assorted tribes.
</p>

<p>(2) <b>Teachers</b>. Within each tradition there are numerous authorities. Dhyana, for instance, contains many yogic systems, starting with those described by Krishna in the <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite> and continuing with every ambitious guru &mdash; each of whom introduces idiosyncratic practices (that work for him), and their associated vocabularies.
</p>

<p>(3) <b>Degrees</b>. Even assuming that we were discussing a single neurological axis, there are any number of arbitrary states whose boundaries are ill defined in the absence of objective instrumental measures. Given that we know neither the number of neurological axes, nor how they interact, nor how to measure positions along them in real time, nor how objective measures and subjective experience correlate, we are left with verbal descriptions that are more poetic than precise.
</p>

<p>(4) <b>Individual Variations</b>. No 2 brains are identical, and there is no reason why one person&apos;s ASCs should be identical to another&apos;s. We agree that a certain color is blue because we can point to it, but there is no way of describing my blue to you that doesn&apos;t involve pointing to others things we both call blue. It may be that if I looked through your occipital lobe, grass would be blue and the sky <i>octarine</i>, a sensation unknown to my brain. We can&apos;t establish a common vocabulary for ASCs except by pointing to instrumental records, but this tells us nothing about the subjective experiences.
</p>

<p>In the Pali tradition there are 4 <i>rupajhana</i> which differ by level:
</p>

<table  class="tcen" style="text-align : center;">
<thead>
<tr><td></td>
	<th>Experiencing<br>the object of<br> meditation</th>
	<th>Rapture</th>
    <th>&emsp;Joy&emsp;</th>
    <th>Concen-<br>tration</th>
	<th>Equan-<br>imity</th></tr>

<tr><th>4th <i>jhana</i></th>
	<td> &mdash; </td><td> &mdash; </td>
	<td> &mdash; </td>
	<td>*</td><td>*</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<p class="flu">and 4 &lsquo;formless&rsquo; <i>arupajhana</i> which differ by object:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li>5th <i>jhana</i>: infinite space,</li>
<li>6th <i>jhana</i>: infinite consciousness,</li>
<li>7th <i>jhana</i>: infinite nothingness,</li>
<li>8th <i>jhana</i>: neither perception nor non-perception.</li>
</ul>


<p>Because we are limited to first-person description of ASCs, and have no means of establishing a second-person description &mdash; as by reading a dial recording some aspect of a meditator&apos;s brain and being able to say, &lsquo;You are in the same state that you called so-and-so&rsquo; &mdash; there is endless debate which contributes little to understanding. How, exactly, do &lsquo;joy&rsquo; and &lsquo;rapture&rsquo; differ?</p>

<p>Apparently the sequence of <i>jhanas</i> overlaps the <i>zazen</i> and <i>savikalpi samadhi</i> range in <a href="#F1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>. These detailed classifications clearly require more exploration than we have room for, but it is significant that among the <i>rupajhanas</i>, progress is made by eliminating asterisks. Is this reminiscent of James Austin&apos;s description of his mystical experience as parts of his brain shut down? <a class="fn">Brahmavamso°<span>
	A Brahmavamso (2003) <cite>The Jhanas</cite> (Buddhist Fellowship, Singapore): 63.
<br>-----------------------<br>
	Recommended. Less hand-waving jargon per concept than anything else I&apos;ve met.
</span></a> refers to the <i>jhana</i> states as stages of blissful <i>letting go</i>. &lsquo;First one lets go of the body and the world, of the five senses [sensory/motor frontal lobe?; occipital lobe?]. Then one lets go of the doer [left temporal lobe?]. Then one lets go of pleasure and displeasure [limbos?]. The one lets go of space and consciousness [right parietal lobe?]. Then one lets go of all knowing [prefrontal lobe?].&rsquo;</p>

<p>The deliberately provocative &lsquo;thumb-sucking&rsquo; hypothesis has 3 components. None requires a signal source external to the brain:
	<a href="A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt=”NewIdea”></a>
</p>

<ol class="oA">
<li><i>Jhanas</i> operationally result from shutting down parts of the brain (probably by teaching parasympathetic nerves to constrict blood vessels, in which case the difficulty of reaching &lsquo;higher&rsquo; states is the difficulty of exerting conscious control over an autonomic system, and learning could be expedited with biofeedback);</li>

<li>Relevant areas of the newborn brain contain minimal information at birth, and although they are filled by later experience, when shut down they register as &lsquo;empty&rsquo;;</li>

<li>Shutting down the left (&lsquo;I&rsquo;) hemisphere results in &lsquo;Jill Taylor&apos;s nirvana&rsquo;, by returning it to the newborn condition B.</li></ol>


<p class="flu">With sufficient effort (such as invasive surgery), these are probably testable:</p>

<ol class="o2">
<li>To test A, one constricts (or observes) specific blood vessels of an adept who has names for various ASCs in a double-blind experiment;</li>

<li>Testing B is more problematic, but perhaps scans of the newborn brain could tell us something, and infant psychologists have found clever ways of telling what is going on inside the baby brain;</li>

<li>Shutting down one hemisphere is tricky because brain arteries evolved to prevent this, but it can be done.
