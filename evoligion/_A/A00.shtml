<p class="epi">Recall the presidential cartoon from 2017:
Washington claims ‘I cannot tell a lie’; Nixon admits ‘I cannot
tell the truth’ — and a bewildered Trump complains, <a class=
"fn">‘I cannot tell the difference’°. <span>This originated as a
Mike Peters cartoon with President Carter as the 3rd president, but
Carter was just trying to be all things to all men, following his
hero Paul (1 Corinthians 9:19-23). Trump suffered from a more serious
debility.</span></a></p>

<p><i>Apologia</i>: This book might have been titled less
presumptuously as <cite>Mysteries: A Conjecture, Some Problems,
Bandaids</cite>. If the last 12,000 years have taught us anything,
it is that what little we do know about our world, ourselves, and
our predicament is often not widely believed. The inevitable result
is that we fail to make rational public decisions even when we have
good information. At least part of this failure comes from teaching
our children the <i>results</i> of learning instead of the
<i>method</i> of learning. We then get adults who have no way to
distinguish fact from opinion.</p>

<p>The way we tell the difference is with a long and careful
process:</p>
<pre style="line-height:0.8">
    Frame a hypothesis 𝄆 Test it - (fail) - Refine the hypothesis 𝄇
                                \
                                 (pass) - Accept hypothesis provisionally
</pre>
<p class="flu">where the odd symbols are musical ‘repeat’ notation:
every time the hypothesis fails the test, improve it and retest it,
until its answer is within current experimental error. (It is then
up to the experimentalists to make better measurements.) This
simple, sophisticated, process has the unique property, among all
modes of acquiring knowledge, of being ultimately self correcting.
It may take a century or two to discover and fix an error, but
eventually it gets there. Simple Newtonian gravity works for nearly
everything terrestrial, but it fails for satellite navigation
(which requires complicated&nbsp;Einsteinian gravity) and it fails
for the rotation of galaxies (for which we need dark matter, or
modified Newtonian dynamics — neither of which currently fixes all
problems — or something yet to be discovered).</p>

<p>What we find is that (except for mathematics) ‘Truth’ seems
always to be provisional and contingent, approachable only by a
series of succcessive approximations. Even then, our best tools do
not work well where we need them most, in dealing with free will.
(Recall too, that Facebook, Putin, Cambridge Analytica and Fox
‘News’ lumbered us with a deplorable example of what happens when
free will is not guided by critical analysis and leavened by
<i>caritas</i>.) Nonetheless, despite the problems, the bottom line
is that <b>until we can design a test that an idea will fail if it
is wrong</b>, we have no way of knowing how close it comes to being
right. However much we might want it to work, or be a god-given
truth, it remains a human's best guess. In what follows, this fact
puts limits on what we know, and suggests some as yet untested
hypotheses.</p>

<a href="#!"><h4>A THEORY OF RELIGION</h4></a>
<a class="tri" href="#02">⩔  </a>
<a class="tri" href="#03">▽  </a>

<p class="epi">Centuries of debate on the origin of ethics come
down to this: Either ethical precepts, such as justice and human
rights,<br>
• are independent of human experience [Transcendentalism], or
else<br>
• they are human inventions [Empiricism].<br>
The distinction is more than an exercise for academic philosophers.
The choice between the assumptions makes all the difference in the
way we view ourselves as a species. It measures the authority of
religion, and it determines the conduct of moral reasoning. — E.O.
Wilson, <cite>Consilience</cite></p>

<p>This is a book about a new theory of religion. If you have never
felt a need for one of those, you might wonder why it is so
important that it deserves a book today. Wasn't that sort of thing
settled long ago?</p>

<p>The short answer is that for many people, religion is a way of
making sense of a complicated world. But it goes about it in a
strange way, by doubling its complexity. Parallel to the observable
world, lies a world known only to its initiates, who insist that
this second world is more important to us than the one we interact
with directly. In the childhood of our race there were good and
valid reasons for belief in the supernatural, and we will come to
them shortly — but we (or some of us) outgrew them 3 millennia ago. Today
our belief in the spirit world is most notable for being abused by
the crafty and unprincipled. (Example: during the 2004 campaign,
George W. Bush, reportedly told Amish farmers, ‘I trust God speaks
through me.’ He was not being mystical: He was, according to
<cite>The Onion</cite>, convinced that Dick Cheney, speaking
paternally over the White House intercom, was the <a href=
"http://www.theonion.com/article/voice-of-god-revealed-to-be-cheney-on-intercom-1851" class="fk">voice of god.</a> ‘I'm driven with a mission from God.
God would tell me: <q>George, go and fight those terrorists in
Afghanistan</q>. And I did, and then God would tell me: <q>George,
go and end the tyranny in Iraq</q>, and I did.’ ‘Officials
privately acknowledged that there is reason to believe that the
vice president, as God, urged Bush to sign legislation benefiting
oil companies in 2005.’</p>

<p>In the hope that not all divine revelation is this sleazy, there
are as many theories of religion as there are people who have
thought about the question. (~200 historical theories are
epitomized <a href="../_B/B6a.shtml#TOC">below</a>.) More to the
point, <i>your</i> theory of religion — even if it is implicit and
unarticulated — determines how you respond to religious ideas, and
whether <i>you</i> or <i>they</i> are in control. Some consequences
of various theories indicates how often — and how unpredictably! —
a theory of religion affects daily life. The short list offers
paraphrases of actual statements, some related earnestly, some
inscribed in sacred texts and political platforms:</p>


<ul class="u1">
<li>God wants me to kill you because you don't believe what I
believe!</li>

<li>If I blow myself up to kill some Jews, I get 72 renewable
virgins, an <a class="fn">eternal° <span>and incredibly
awkward</span></a> erection, and infinite posthumous orgasms.</li>

<li>Wealth is a reward for faith, so income tax is theft of god's
reward!</li>

<li>The Mahdi will return after we initiate <a class=
"fn">Armageddon°. <span>Not to be an alarmist, but some recent
Iranian prime ministers have suggested that a single nuclear bomb
dropped on Israel would be sufficient to produce this greatly
desired result. (The Mahdi then leads the jihad which conquers the
world for Allah.)</span></a></li>

<li>Christ will return after the last tree has been <a class=
"fn">chopped down°. <span>Reagan's Secretary of the Interior seems
really to have believed this.</span></a></li>

<li>I know he is virtuous because he says a prayer before <a class=
"fn">every meal°. <span>She said this of the married man she was
having an affair with.</span></a></li>

<li>God watches and judges everything I do.</li>

<li>We should go to church once in a while.</li>

<li>Meh.</li>

<li>Religion is the most profitable tool of oppression — and the
most welcomed by the oppressed.</li>

<li>Revealed religions are arbitrary.</li>

<li>That which you hate, do not do to sentient beings.</li>
</ul>

suggestion that ‘the process of purification may be carried
further’ and the <a class="fn">list extended°. <span>
	There will be
more lists. They may be a habit left over from an earlier life as a
Buddhist. (Lists are for 1-dimensional sequences; tables for
2-dimensional collections, or occasionally 3-dimensional, with one

</span></a> to date. We have field work for
1257 cultures, of which 556 are statistically independent. (For
example, the 2000-odd Christian sects of the US are <i>not</i>
independent, and count as a single religion in this approach,
despite their antagonistic incompatibility.) In other words, we
have a minimum of 556 conflicting sets of god-prescribed behavior,
each with equivalent empirical support from its embedding culture.
The enquiring mind wonders:</p>


<ul>
<li>Are there many gods?</li>

<li>One very confused god?</li>

<li>A god and an anti-god?</li>

<li>Are we part of an experiment?</li>

<li>Were the instructions delivered by a Trickster?</li>

<li>Have we misunderstood something?</li>

<li>How can we tell?</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot reach a consensus view because there
are contradictory instructions on central issues. With a strictly
statistical approach, if we believe that our choice is the one that
god prefers, our probability of being right is, at best, 1 in 556
(0.0018 or less, if the ‘right’ version of religion isn't among the
ones we've counted). Curiously, this seldom bothers believers, who
seem to know instinctively that the other 3 religions they have
heard of are wrong. The penalty for choosing the wrong religion,
according to some of the others, is eternal damnation, so the
stakes are high. The True Believer is betting everything on hearsay
— for the very best Scripture is hearsay from the outset. The human
mind cannot live comfortably with this level of anxiety, and
customarily protects itself by making an arbitrary choice and an
irrational denial of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Using the words ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ in a discussion of religion
suggests that one declare his own bias. As best I can tell, the
major components of my own ‘religion’ are more or less as shown in
Fig. 0.1. This Figure also suggests the experiences which
contribute to locating the blob. Note the persistent effect of
early exposure, and the relative influence of limbic (Seminary) and
cortical (MIT post-graduate) education. As with most deist
agnostics, the resulting philosophy is a deeply empowering
commitment to an optimistic vision of human possibilities.</p>

<p>A naturalistic world view admits that there is a vast amount
that we do not understand about the universe — such as why there is
<i>something</i> rather than nothing, and why, if there is
something, it is <i>this</i> something. We have figured out a lot
of the laws of the universe, but we don't know why we have these
laws instead of another set. While we write the laws in the
language of differential equations (appropriate for continuous
media), we have to solve them as difference equations (understood
by digital computers). But what if the difference equations are the
real ones (which would be appropriate if space and time were
quantized at the Planck limit) and the differential equations were
the approximation? (Spacial quantization resolves Zeno's paradox,
and nothing else does.) Fredkin made a career out of investigating
this question, but a lifetime was too short. He did well to inspire
a grad student to invent a digitization with spherical
symmetry.</p>

<p>In the time-honored manner of creating our gods in our own
image, I accept the possibility of reincarnation being part of
‘this something’ because if it were my universe, that's the way I
would run it, anything else seeming both wasteful and
uninteresting. (We know so little about our world that any
scientist worth his salt can suggest mechanisms that do not
conflict with anything we have learned.)</p>

<p class="epi">Some believers accuse skeptics of having nothing
left but a dull, cold, scientific world. I am left with only art,
music, literature, theater, the magnificence of nature,
mathematics, the human spirit, sex, the cosmos, friendship,
history, science, imagination, dreams, oceans, mountains, love and
the wonder of birth. That'll do for me. — Lynne Kelly [… cats?]</p>

<p>We will try to ascertain why religion is so important to us, how
it got that way, what its original function might have been. Almost
incidentally we will also be testing a question central to the
usual interpretation of religion: Do supernaturalism and magical
thinking <a class="fn"><i>work°?</i> <span>
	Manifestly, they ‘work’
in the sociobiological sense of generating community and synthetic
kinship. The question asks whether they have any effect on the
<i>physical</i> world.</span></a></p>

</span></a> would reduce the 200-odd theories of
religion <a href="../_B/B06.shtml">below</a> to two categories:
religion as racket, and religion as madness. If this is realistic,
we are adding a third category, <b>religion as a way to increase
viability</b>, a function that was entirely positive, biologically
defensible — and deplorably short-lived.</p>

<p>We can't have killed for religion in the days when it worked, so
we need to discover what went wrong. We want to see where, when,
and why this occurred. We might like to make religion a Good Thing
once again, in which case we need to know how to fix it, and how it
might once again become helpful to us instead of a source of
difficulties. The better teachers — Socrates, Buddha, and Zoroaster
come to mind — suggested to their disciples that their own
teachings could be, and should be, improved. (There is little to be
hoped for from the rigid systems of those who claimed to have the
final vision of human progress.)</p>

<p>We might take the epic of Gilgamesh, from Mesopotamia ~2100 BCE,
as our earliest example of written religion. Fragmentary cuneiform
tables occur over a 2-millennium span: Fig. 0.3 reproduces a late
version (and the earliest discovered).</p>

Gilgamesh in cuneiform. The Assyrians got the story from older
Mesopotamian cultures, and this tablet is a late version. After <a class="fn">George Smith (1880)°, <span>
	<cite>The Chaldean Account of Genesis</cite>, revised and corrected by AH Sayce (Charles Scribner's
Sons, NYC)
</span></a> who discovered, reconstructed, and translated this
tablet, and died at 36 of dysentery on a later expedition hunting
more tablets.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>This tablet was found in the ruins of Ashurbanipal's Royal
Assyrian Library, Nineveh, which was destroyed ~600 BCE, some 3500
years after the flood described by the tablet. The library was on
an upper story; the tablets were broken, burned, trampled by
treasure hunters, and suffered further cracking by salt crystals
after various local floods. Some 20,000 fragments were salvaged by
the British Museum, and over the years, reassembled as shown, and
translated to tell the story of Noah (although he is here called
Izdubar, and his ark landed on Mount Nizir).</p>

<p>Old as this story is, it and all of the traditional aspects of
religion are late developments. Theology (conjectures about the
existence and nature of gods) is irrelevant for the first 30-odd
millennia. Soteriology (concern about personal salvation) is not
important until the dawn of history. Our interest begins with the
Urzeit of Fig. 0.4.</p>

Urzeit, or critical period for the invention of religion —
40,000–25,000 years ago — long antedates known religions. We will
explain these dates below, but it is important to understand how
distant a time we are dealing with. Polls suggest that the colored

failure of 5th-grade education.<br>

	Much has happened since the Paleolithic —
including transmission of religion to societies which neither
invented it, nor got out of the Paleolithic by
themselves.

this step. On the other hand, the 100,000 religions display an
amazing variety of beliefs. One suspects that <b>the details of
belief are irrelevant</b>, and that the essence was something very
simple.</p>

<p>This is important enough to re-phrase. <span class="br">Without

<a href="#!"><h5>Degrees of Certainty</h5></a>
<a class="tri" href="#06">⩔  </a>

<p class="epi">Lorem ipsum ...</p>

<p>Having now used both ‘theory’ and ‘hypothesis’, we should be
clear about the difference, because science distinguishes
categories of certainty more precisely than does casual
conversation. In general:</p>


<ul class="u1">
<li><b>Conjecture</b>: Formally, an unproven theorem, like the
Goldbach conjecture: <i>Every even integer can be expressed as the
sum of two primes</i>. Example: 256 = 239 + 17. A large integer
might someday falsify the conjecture. Informally, ‘an opinion based
on incomplete information’.</li>

<li><b>Hypothesis</b>: A proposed explanation made on the basis of
limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.
Example: <i>Religion was once a good thing</i>. Strictly speaking,
hypotheses should be accompanied by ways to falsify them: all I can
suggest here is that I deem religion responsible for the most
important evolutionary event in the last 200,000 years, for which
there is no convincing alternative explanation.</li>

<li><b>Theory</b>: A system of ideas that explains something, based
on general principles independent of the ‘something’. E.g.: The
<i>theory of evolution</i> explains most of what taxonomy,
comparative anatomy, physiological development, and DNA analysis

<p>Evolution is going to play a major part in what follows. For
anyone uncomfortable with evolutionary explanations, there is an
excellent discussion of the interplay of biological and cultural
evolution (with 70 references in one footnote) in van der Dennen's

<p>The limitations of speciation-by-accumulation-of-small-changes
were recognized by Darwin. Since his day several faster ways to
generate new taxa have been recognized. The box below updates the
8000-year-old description prevalent in the Bible Belt, where these
facts seem not to be taught in middle school.</p>
<br>

<aside>

<p>There are several mechanisms of ‘saltational evolution’ that
reach beyond new species into higher taxa or incorporate working
systems into new organisms. These re-arrangements are rare events,
but they produce new forms instantaneously. If they do not happen
to create visible skeletal changes, there will be nothing to
identify them as intermediates in the fossil record. The child
generation is probably as well adapted as the parental generation,
and only later does it find itself an econiche which it makes its
own. We have little idea how often such events occur, because the
unsuccessful ones never appear. Such experiments might be very
common, with numerous unnoticed failures.</p>

rearrange control genes, and makes the

duplication, so that parent and child generations have lowered
interfertility. This leads to the differential accumulation of
single-point mutations, and eventual breeding isolation. We know
this works, because it is the process that repeatedly <a href=

</span></a> to discover a mechanism for their so-called ‘species barrier’
which could <i>prevent</i> the evolution of new species. The boundaries
are so porous; hybrids, races, clines, and subspecies are so common; and
changes with time so inevitable, that in 200 years no one has been
able to define ‘species’ in a way that satisfies workers in all
disciplines.</p>

<p>When you observe specialists trying to kill eachother over
differing ideas about evolution and genetics, remember this: Life
is so various, so inventive, and so ready to break all of its
rules, that it will be a long time before we understand all of the
by-ways of evolution. Darwin was right; and 1000 evolutionary
biologists are demonstrating that there were subtle details that he
didn't observe — probably because the necessary tools wouldn't be
invented for another 150 years.</p>

<p>Oddly, when such mechanisms come to the attention of <a href=
"http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/11/a_lapse_in_watc078601.html"> creationists</a>, they do not recognize that their understanding of evolution
is severely limited, but interpret the new-found mechanisms as proof
that evolution is wrong, so they must be right. Upon hearing about
epigenetics, their blogs rejoiced with ‘I told you so! Evolution
doesn't work…’, without adding ‘the way I thought it did.’</p>
</aside>


<p>Another common sticking point is that evolution denies us any
special purpose in the grand scheme of things, and this offends the
<i>amour propre</i> of people who feel that they were specially
created by some god. There is an obvious response to this desire
for significance, which we will come to in due time.</p>

</span></a>Nevertheless, it is the claim of this book that we would still
be living as antagonistic tribes had we not invented religion. The
first defining characteristic of religion is that <b>it must be a
supratribal mythos</b>, extending beyond the range of genetic
kinship and purely biological concerns. The definition used here
will make better sense when its terminology is explained in detail,
but in 25 words (discounting the parenthesis):</p>

<p>Because this definition is so specialized, I will also use 2

<ul>
<li>The vernacular usage that deals with gods and their

<li>A more adventurous usage that describes potential philosophical

vernacular concept of ‘religion’ in their extension of synthetic
kinship, but they all fall within Tillich's broad rubric of
‘ultimate concern’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coupled with the mythic backstory of the front <a href=

<a href="#!"><h5>Viability</h5></a>
<a class="tri" href="#09">⩔  </a>

<p>We have twice used ‘viability’ without defining it. A <a class=
"fn">numerical definition° <span>AWF Edwards (2000)
<cite>Mathematical Genetics</cite> 2nd ed. (Cambridge University
Press, Cambridge UK).</span></a> from mathematical genetics will

<ul class="u2">
<li><b><i>Viability</i> is the fraction of children who survive to
breed.</b></li>

<li><b><i>Evolution</i> is an increase in viability.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The definitions are not trickery, but common-sense.
Statistically, barring disasters, other populations are stable. As
we go up the phylogenetic tree, viability increases. Despite a
generation time as short as 20 minutes, the mean number of bacteria
does not increase, so all bacterial ‘descendants’ die. A codfish
may lay 100 million eggs — of which 2 survive to breed. A cat may
have 75 kittens — of whom 2 breed. Americans in 1920 needed
<a class="fn">3 children° <span>MM Knight, IL Peters, P Blanchard
(1921) <cite>Taboo And Genetics: A Study of the Biological

maintain a stable population. Today it takes <a class="fn">2.2
children° <span>This decrease is sociomedical, and a demonstration
that evolution proceeds at all levels simultaneously. DNA,
chromosomes, organelles, cells, organs, individuals, groups,
societies, and civilizations all interact, and some thrive better
than others. The one which can devote the least effort to
reproduction has the most resources for leaving a better
environment for its offspring and thus improving their probability
of survival.</span></a> per family, of whom 2 breed. There would be
less unhappiness if we could reduce this number to 2.1.</p>

<p>Add to these definitions 2 facts — that children are not
identical to parents, and that some children thrive better than
others — and we have the crux of the story told by Anaximander,
Aristotle, Augustine, al-Jahiz, Ibn Khaldun, Maupertius, Linnaeus,
Cuvier, Hutton, Lamarck, Malthus, Lyell, Wallace, <a class=
"fn">Darwin°, <span>Darwin acknowledged 34 previous writers who
‘believe in the modification of species, or at least disbelieve in
separate acts of creation’.<br>

Huxley, Sutton, Dobzhansky, Muller, Beadle, Watson, Crick,
Nierenberg, Todd, Gould, Eldridge, Margulis, Kornicki, and the
hundreds who filled in the details. The result is that a larger
fraction of our children survive. That's all there is to
evolution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this approach is likely to be a stumbling block
for fundamentalist believers, unhappy to find ‘religion’ paired
with ‘evolution’. The definitions leave those who reject evolution
in the uncomfortable position of approving of childhood mortality.
(The easiest way out is denial of the validity of mathematical
genetics, an arcane discipline that few have met. Unfortunately,
that's a bit like denying mathematics, since it is a discipline of
pure logic, given the observable laws of genetics.)</p>

<p>However much denial soothes the fundamentalist soul, the fact
remains that we can measure the exceptional increase of viability
that occurs when the first intimations of religion appear in the
fossil record. This so far exceeds <a href=

as implausible a story as we have, yet it is our most numerically
accurate theory. Thus, pothodoxy describes belief in a
6000-year-old Earth or angels with 70,000 pairs of wings, but not
belief in the Copenhagen or Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics, which is a currently undecidable choice.</p>

<p>Pothodoxy is more fully characterized by Nicholas Wade as
<a class="fn"><cite>The Faith Instinct</cite>°<span>
	N Wade (2009) <cite>The Faith Instinct</cite> (Penguin, London): 244.
</span></a>— an altogether gentler and more sympathetic book than this
one, yet including examples of pothodoxy ‘compelling [people] to
override the strongest human emotions, including those of
self-preservation and the protection of family’. I take
<b>‘Gibbon's Gambit’</b> as the type example of pothodoxy:</p>


<blockquote>So urgent … is the necessity of believing, that the
fall of any system of mythology will most probably be succeeded by
the introduction of some other mode of superstition. — <a class=
"fn">Gibbon°. <span>

the Roman Empire</cite> O Smeaton (ed.), 3 vols. (Modern Library,

<p>‘Pothodoxy’ implies more than fanatical belief and misevaluation
of probability, and carries connotations of a pathological
predilection for supernatural dualism.</p>

	‘YHVH’ is a courtesy to
a venerable tradition of word magic. Based on Deuteronomy 12:4, the
Talmud {Shev. 35a} forbids writing the name of the Old Testament
deity explicitly lest the page on which it is written be
accidentally destroyed. ‘YHVH’, without the vowels, seems to be a
discardable form in aid of recycling. According to the Talmud {Kid.
71a}, even the pronunciation of ‘YHVH’ is proscribed: ‘Not as I am
written am I pronounced. I am written <i>yod he vav he</i>, and I
am pronounced <i>alef daleth nun yod</i> ’ — that is, Adonai,
translated ‘Lord’. Although Shabbetai (17th cent.) and Akiva (19th
cent.) state ‘emphatically that the prohibition applies only to the
names in Hebrew but not in the vernacular’ {<cite>Encyc.
Judaica</cite> 7: 682}, some still worry about discarding their
deity's full name in English. I thank David Brin for bringing this
to my attention.
</span></a> and Zeus. As Trickster, he told
everyone a different story. Why the Great Spirit sent a Trickster
and Shapeshifter as demiurge remains a mystery. European
theologians would have argued over it for millennia — with armies —
without arriving at a satisfactory conclusion. A thousand Native
American tribes simply accept it as an observed fact, like a rain
shower, but the consensus is that this is a test. For reasons
inscrutable to man, the Great Spirit wants people to be able to see
through Coyotl's trickery (a skill somewhat lacking among
palefaces).</p>

<p>Coyotl has left us any number of ‘revealed’ Words in the 100,000
religious stories, and one existing Work: the universe. I suggest
that the manifest Work speaks louder than the multifarious

<p>The vernacular understanding of religion as the discipline which
deals with theology and soteriology is relevant only to the last
5000 years. Our interest lies before, and after, this much studied
period. Before, to learn what religion was for; after, because our
planetary ecosystem will <i>not</i> survive the next critical
century unless our belief systems match our world's needs. For too
long, we have accepted as ‘religion’ whatever its prophet said.
This is tantamount to believing a used-car salesman.</p>

	For the record, my thinking about Gaia

<p class="epi">The first humans […lived] a ‘beast-like life’
without any arts or technologies, co-operation or society. Then
they procure for themselves houses, skins and fire, and begin to
live a settled existence with marriage, children, and family life.
This leads to a softening, both physical and psychological, <b>that

</span></a> was among the first
to address the question of how we became civilized. ‘Beast-like’ is
too broad for our purposes, and I will focus on the behavior of the
alpha-male of social animals, referring to it as ‘Instinct-1’. It
gave us ownership of the planet, but alone, it is incompatible with
civilization because its rule of social interaction — most highly
developed in the chimpanzee-human clade — is ‘See a stranger, Kill
it!’.</p>

<p>The contrasting cooperative aspect is then ‘Instinct-2’. The
range of the Instincts will become clearer as we go, but
fundamentally:</p>


<table><tr>
<td class="rc" style="padding:10px;">Instinct-1 = Me,   Instinct-2
= We.</td>
</tr></table>


<p class="flu">It is characteristic of Instinct-2 that ‘we’ expands
with individual development to include anything from ‘family’ to
‘universe’. A <i>sine qua non</i> for considering anything a
religion is that it oppose Instinct-1 in favor of Instinct-2,
behavior we will term <a class="fk" href=

	Bob Love presented a colloquial interpretation in
US political terms that had escaped me: ‘The opposite of <q>Me</q>
is either <q>Them</q> or <q>Us</q>, depending on whether you're an
R or a D.’ This may mean that the 2-instinct approach is simply
opaque or incomprehensible to the Rs.
</span></a></p>

<p>A not-unrelated characterization of Instinct-2 is <a class=
"fn">Alasdair MacIntyre's° <span>
	(1999) <cite>Dependent Rational
Animals</cite> (Carus Publishing, Chicago).
</span></a> insight that
humans are ‘dependent rational animals’. We are not, as so many
world-views proclaim, intrinsically superior to animals. We are
anomalous animals, outliers like the proboscideans who specialized
in prehensile noses, except that we specialized in brain growth.
This eventually led to the <i>possibility</i> of rationality. But
like all specializations, it carries a price, which in our case is
the double whammy of inter-dependence, and responsibility for our
actions. These can be thought of as the Eirenic and Gaian
components of our fate.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there were two
	<a href="#14"><img class="im"
		src="../Images/K-Theater3.gif"
		alt="Theater"></a>
handsome and phenomenally successful brothers (call them Abel and Baker — or
better, Charlie and David), greatly skilled at industrial
processes, but greatly lacking in Instinct-2. One day while
polishing the handles on their coke ovens, a djinn appeared before
them and granted them 3 wishes. Astonished, they nevertheless
managed an immediate and instinctive: ‘We want it all!’. They
agreed on good health in which to enjoy it all. Then, aware of how
often 3 wishes have turned sour, they negotiated a day's
postponement for careful thought.</p>

<p>The next evening, when David spoke to the djinn privately, he
asked for ‘the quick demise of his brother’ so <i>he</i> could have
it all. ‘Of course!’, said the relieved djinn, ‘I was afraid you'd
make a fourth wish, and I'd have to disappoint one of you.’</p>

<p>Our religions encourage biodiversity loss, ignorance of
thermodynamics, short-term thinking, resource consumption,
overpopulation, and other ecocidal stupidities. The challenge is to
reinterpret existing religions in a way that motivates True
Believers to survival-oriented action to minimize the primary
threats. There is no dearth of work to be done. Environmental
activism (e.g., <a class="fn">Sea Shepherd)° <span>
	Sea Shepherd's campaign of harassing the Japanese whaling fleet with ‘red paint, smoke bombs and rancid butter’ reduced Japan's 2010-2011 Antarctic
whale killing to 20% of its planned goal {Hosa11}. Japan calls the
hunt ‘scientific’, studying ‘mortality rates, whale stock numbers
and structure, the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem and
how environmental changes affect whales’. Do Japanese scientists
find it necessary to kill Japanese citizens to study their
mortality rates or numbers? See {Garl11} for an example of real
cetacean science, an 11-year study of cultural transmission of
social behavior which killed no whales at all. In fact, 22 years
and 11,000 dead whales later, Japan has yet to produce any
substantial research {Roes09}.<br>

Eirenic components of religion, however unpopular that makes
religion with conservatives. The energy that inspires obsolete
Instinct-1 in the forms of jihad, terrorism, attacks on
family-planning centers, attempts to revoke evolution, and the
feudofascist urge to empower corporations to the detriment of
people, is crying for redirection into repairing our life-support
system and creating a sustainable life style.</p>

<p>Survival requires that we find something ecologically true and
broadly popular, which pothodoxy can fasten onto. For evolutionary
reasons, this will be difficult. But the alternative is
<i>truly</i> unpleasant and fast becoming unavoidable. I will refer
to the missing but essential ecological aspect of religion as
<i>Gaian</i>.</p>

<p>Note that a religion can be Gaian without involving worship of
Gaia. This is a courtesy to James Lovelock, who explained that his
(geophysiological) Gaia should never be the basis of a religion,
because religions are <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#31" class=

<p>It is true that some corporations are idealistic in their youth:
think of Google's original ‘Don't be evil’. But the very fact that
such a constraint needs mentioning suggests the inevitability of
evil whenever it is profitable. Before long, what religious
prophets decry as evil become the values of the 1‰: think of Gordon
Gekko's ‘Greed is good!’ (<cite>Wall Street</cite> cinematic
fiction, but an accurate portrayal, modelled in part on Director
Oliver Stone's father and in part on a convicted junk-bond
king).</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon dominance among the US 1‰ seems to inspire an
attitude that can be traced back to Runnymede, where the barons of
Britain limited the power of the crown with the Magna Carta. While
this event has been seen as producing the seminal document of
Anglo-American constitutional practice, it was never intended by
the barons to apply to their serfs. There is a very medieval
feeling to today's far right — not only do they want all the money
in sight and control of the government, but they require serfs so
they can feel superior. This combination of corporatism and
feudalism I will call</p>
<p class="bcr">feudofascism, combining the private psychopathy of
the alpha male with the public sociopathy of the corporation.</p>

<p>Teddy Roosevelt was the first to counter feudofascism, with the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 (but first enforceable only in 1902
with the loss of the Supreme Court's fascist majority). Teddy went
after robber barons J. P. Morgan, J.J. Hill, and E.H. Harriman — to
the great dismay of Morgan, who objected to being identified as a
criminal. Suits against 44 other oligopolies followed. His ‘Square
Deal’ included control of corporations, consumer protection, and
conservation of natural resources — 3 processes that are again in
need of attention.</p>

<p>It required considerable effort and sacrifice by outsiders to
nip Hitler's ‘1000-year Reich’ in the bud. We do not have this
advantage, for no outsiders are going to <a class="fn">come to our
aid°. <span>At least, probably not to our <i>military</i> aid,
although Germany, The Netherlands, and France offered moral and
practical support in the time of Trump, for which I thank
them</span></a> This is our very own ultimate concern; the defense
of a unique idea — government for the benefit of the governed —
whose roots lie in the Enlightenment and the vision of the prophets
of the <a class="fn">Axial Age°. <span>The most realistic analysis
of the historical Jesus is that he was a Hassidic rabbi whose
agenda was the removal of the Roman overlord in favor of an earthly
manifestation of the kingdom of god, governed by an ‘ethical code
[whose] sublimity, distinctiveness and originality in form
unparalleled in any other Hebrew ethical code’.<br>

Gospels</cite> (William Collins, London).<br>
• J Klausner (1922) <cite>Jesus of Nazareth, His Life, Times, and
Teaching</cite> (Macmillan, NYC, 1925).</span></a></p>

<p>Feudofascism is neither a scare word nor a conspiracy theory,
but an observable process, recognized and quantified by academic
specialists, who call its early stages by a gentler name: Economic
Elite Domination. We can think of it is as ‘Rule by the 1‰’, as
shown in Table 0.2. Using multivariate analysis, the authors tested
nearly 1800 political decisions made between 1981 and 2002, ‘in
which a national survey of the general public was asked a
favor/oppose question about a proposed policy change’. The facts
that ‘the people’ won 5% of the time, and that 5% and 78% do not
add to 100%, simply mean that some issues were unimportant, and
others were not resolved within 4 years of the survey.</p>

<p>In the sort of democracy that the Enlightenment envisioned, the
Deep State would not exist, the green rows would have a success
rate of 99% and the red rows, 1‰, meaning that the 1‰ would have 1‰
of the political power. You may be sure that the greedy (why do we
call them ‘elite’?), currently having all 3 branches of the US
government in their <a class="fn">pocket°, <span>This should be a
transient situation, but as of the 2016 presidential primaries, the
candidates should have been (by my norms) Hilary Clinton for the
Republicans and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, so far has the
‘center’ shifted right. As it was, the Republicans could not field
a single acceptable candidate (out of 20) unless a Hitler wannabe
is your ideal.</span></a> see a millennial opportunity to obtain
100% of the power over anything that they can agree on. Recall that
the first act of the 115th (Republican majority) Congress in 2017
was a 119-to-74 vote to neuter the Office of Congressional Ethics,
giving the impression — widely shared by the public — that
Republicans desire a government that encourages unethical business
behavior.</p>

<p>‘Promote the general Welfare’, said the US Constitution, and
this was the goal of the Axial Age and all the better prophets. If
a church isn't actively working to restore majoritarian pluralism,
it isn't doing its job. <span class="fr">■</span></p>

<p class="flu"><a class="en" href="#08">A&nbsp;</a>The evolutionary
explanation in the preceding footnote has been contested, in favor
of Bertrand Russell's linguistic explanation in <a class="fn">‘On
Denoting’°. <span>B Russell (1905) <cite>Mind</cite> <b>14</b>:
479–493.</span></a> Basically, Russell showed that language permits
us to create propositions of the sort ‘the present King of France
is bald’, and then to argue the truth of this and draw conclusions.
Since the present King of France is neither bald nor hirsute
[because at the time of writing, France had no king], Russell
observes that Hegelians, ‘who love a synthesis, will probably
conclude that he wears a wig’. This ability to discuss non-logical
propositions and non-existent entities also means that it is
difficult to keep them out of discourse when they offer plausible
alternatives, so metaphysics enters our thinking unnoticed.</p>

<p>When language was new, all the might-bes of Emphante seemed
worth discussing. Weeding Emphante's garden required ideas like the
<b>Empty Set</b>, and the <b>Law of the Excluded Middle</b>. The
Empty Set is <i>empty</i>, so that statements about its contents
are neither true nor false, but <a class="fn">meaningless°.
<span>Nothing in the Empty Set is red, so that ‘The contents are
not red’ is not a false statement. But it implies that there might
be contents, and that they might be blue, both of which are not
true. ‘Not false’ AND ‘not true’ result in
‘meaningless’.</span></a> The Law of the Excluded Middle (‘<i>x</i>
cannot be both <a class="fn">A and not-A’°) <span>Quantum mechanics
notoriously defies the Law of the Excluded Middle (‘Is it a wave or
a particle?’ to which the most succinct answer is ‘Yes’), which
apparently applies only to ideas about objects large enough to be
visible. Mystically inclined physicists — particularly Indians —
are impressed by this, and feel that Indian philosophy anticipated
modern physics by 4000 years.</span></a> is rejected by Hindu
philosophy, which remains happy to pontificate about things that
both <a class="fk" href=
"http://www.purifymind.com/EasternIdeas.htm">are and are-not°
<span>Ultimate Reality in Jainism may be summed up in the phrase
‘Pluralistic Realism’, known as the <i>Sapta-bhang</i>, or ‘7
maybes’. The choices are:<br>
1) maybe a thing is;<br>
2) maybe it is not;<br>
3) maybe it is and is not;<br>
4) maybe it is inexpressible;<br>
5) maybe a thing is and is inexpressible;<br>
6) maybe a thing is not and is inexpressible;<br>
7) maybe a thing is, is not and is inexpressible.<br>
[The chemistry professor and connoisseur of philosophical doctrines
feels a deep need for illustrative examples of choices 3–7. Just as
a pedagogic tool.]
<br>-----------<br>
S Rai (no date) ‘A Brief History of Eastern Ideas’</span></a> .
However, by the time we had these tools, we had long since accepted
much-beloved traditions about supernatural entities whom we did not
wish to include in <a class="fn">the Empty Set°. <span>See how
easily language allows one to slip into metaphysics? Half a dozen
lines ago, we established that ‘Including something in the Empty
Set’ is a logical impossibility.</span></a> Belief was expected,
and comfortable, and a natural consequence of listening to tales
around the hearth.</p>


<p>The <i>psychology</i> of belief may be explained by this view of
linguistics, but hardly its <i>power</i>, so I stand by my
sociogenetic explanation. Were I by birth a Muslim, and
sufficiently incautious as to let my views be known, I would (by
community preference) be killed — not by sabertooth cats, but by
Muslims infuriated by my unwillingness to accept their consensus.
When the default option is to kill a stranger on sight, and the
only protection from being killed is common belief, alleles
permitting scepticism become very scarce in the population.</p>

<p>Perhaps an example of the variability of instinct would help.
Certain hunting dogs come large and small, lean and blocky, black
and brown, short hair and long, rough coat, curly, and smooth, — in
short, a wide variety of alleles. Their individual behavior is
similarly varied. The divergence of genetically determined
proclivities is illustrated by Aileen Hennes's report of the
behavior of 2 siblings, kept as companions (rather than caged,
bored, and lonely in the native manner). ‘Molf’, tall, <a class=
"fn">philosophical°, <span>Remind him that he is not allowed to
kill cats, and he spends a quarter hour puzzling over this
inexplicable difference between his instincts and The Rules. It is
a recurring problem which he has not satisfactorily
resolved.</span></a> and rough-coat gold, is a killer, running
beside a deer and bumping it until it stumbles. ‘Yuri’, smooth,
small, black, and the alpha male of his pack, is a herder. He will
collect 5 deer and bring them home; or take 3 of 4 bulls while a
farmer is moving them from one pasture to another, and herd them to
the camping trailer: ‘People, look! Dinner!’.</p>

<p>As a result of our Middle Paleolithic propensity for killing the
stranger, we have an impoverished allele pool compared to most
animal populations, and our human ability to modify behavior by
culture may temper the expression of what genetic variability we
have, but that doesn't mean that it isn't there.<a class="en" href=
