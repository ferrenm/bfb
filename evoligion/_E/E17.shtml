<a class="tri" href="#02">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>By 1925, theologian <b>Kirsopp Lake</b> had seen that the distinguishing features of belief were no longer denominational, but a 3-layer response to modernity based on mental flexibility:
</p>

<ul> <li><b>Fundamentalists</b>, &lsquo;strong in conviction but spiritually arrogant and <a class="fn">intellectually ignorant&rsquo;,<span>
	L Geering (2003) <cite>Fundamentalism: the Challenge to the Secular World</cite> (St. Andrews Trust, Wellington NZ).
</span></a> who see their scripture as the direct word of a god: inerrant, unchangeable, and to be applied to everyone (Reptilian brain dominant);</li>

<li><b>Radicals, or Experimentalists</b>, who understand that if the church wants to be relevant in a changing culture, it too must change (Cortex dominant);</li>

<li><b>Institutionalists</b>, viewing Fundamentalists with impatience and Radicals with consternation, who vacillate between weakened traditions and new visions (Limbos dominant).</li> </ul>

<p>Fundamentalists have a monolithic agenda; the Radicals have a wealth of ideas about how to make religion useful again. Consequently, <a class="fn">Lake<span>
	K Lake (1925) <cite>The Religion of Yesterday and Tomorrow</cite> (Houghton Mifflin, Boston).
</span></a> prophesied,
</p>

<blockquote>The fundamentalists will eventually triumph. They will drive the Experimentalists out of the churches and then reabsorb the Institutionalists who, under pressure, will become more orthodox. &hellip; The Church will shrink from <a class="fn">left to right.<span>
	A parallel process seems to have infected the Republican Party.
</span></a>

<p class="epi">The persistence of a creationist narrative in the public understanding of natural history impedes genuine efforts to instill a productive sense of environmental ethics in American law and politics, [thereby impeding the solution of] the most significant problem facing the world. &mdash; <a class="fn">

</span></a>
</p>

<p>Who benefits from this process? Not the churches, which would gladly increase their congregations. Not the public, for churches have on occasion risen to the challenge and led society in a forward step &mdash; but this can happen only when the Experimentalists are in control. Since mid-20th century, it seems that the chief beneficiary has been the <a class="fn">Far Right.<span>
	The Vatican sided with the fascist regimes of Spain, Germany, and Italy in WW II, as the US Bible Belt sides with retrogressive politics today. Pope Francis, however seems to understand more about ecology than any of his predecessors. There is hope!
</span></a> The churches may be smaller, but their attitudes &mdash; and votes &mdash; are more predictable.
</p>

<p>Emperors and armies were Instinct-1's answer to the Axial Age; fundamentalism is its response to Enlightenment. Just as the original function of religion was to allow us to live together peacefully, an appropriate task of the church today would be to mobilize and coordinate group action for mutual benefit. Unfortunately, as &lsquo;mutual&rsquo; begins to include downright undesirables (pigmented skin, strange beliefs), benefiting them becomes anathema to Instinct-1. Awkward clauses in the Constitution actually require the government to include them, so Instinct-1 automatically begins to transform the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo; of the Four Freedoms into a belief that Freedom From Government is the solution to all problems.
</p>

<p>The resulting fundamentalist response is an urge to replace messy (and too often corrupt) democracy with the clear and god-given rules of feudal theocracy. Unfortunately, this is no longer a quaint backwater notion, but a political power bloc, easy to manipulate because every wannabe alpha male thinks he will profit from it, at least around the house. This requires modifying public-school curricula or teaching feudofascism in charter schools, and, as H. Rap Brown <a class="fn">noticed,<span>
	JL Al-Amin (1994) <cite>Revolution by the Book (The Rap is Live)</cite> (Writers&apos; Inc.-International, Beltsville MD).
</span></a> rejecting the Constitution. The attempts to turn school books back 150 years are real and persistent, the Bill of Rights is badly battered &mdash; but these are mere shadows of the theocratic aspirations, fundamentalist values, and right-wing money behind the current drive toward feudofascism.

<a href="#TOC"   id="03"> Why So Many &lsquo;Conservative&rsquo; Institutions? </a>
<a class="tri" href="#03.3">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p class="epi">A century ago, the judge of England's West Riding Assizes explained: &lsquo;A man is not free in any public place to use common ridicule on subjects which are sacred.&rsquo; Nowadays it&apos;s Putin jailing the Pussy Riot band for &lsquo;desecrating&rsquo; a cathedral by singing in it.
</p>

<p>The number of conservative radio talk shows is easy to understand: they are propaganda outlets endlessly telling the unemployed that their plight is not the result of globalization and executive greed, but the fault of immigrants and genetically lazy welfare recipients. But the number of well funded and apparently independent &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; institutions <a href="http://angelsoftheright.net/">active today</a> is bizarre. The questions they claim to address are logically undecidable, their current arguments add nothing that was not said 2 millennia ago, and from a philosophical point of view they serve no purpose. So why have they sprouted like weeds? The mind set is ancient and persistent; no puzzle there &mdash; but it is increasingly out of tune with the current ascendency of science and technology as a way to make money, improve the standard of living, and comprehend the universe. Philosophic dead ends; economic sinks; yet highly visible, some of them publishing 100s of reports annually &mdash; there is something decidedly odd here. The Cato Institute seems devoted to returning to the situation described by the tribune Phillipus: &lsquo;[

T]here are but 2000 individuals in Rome who own anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p> Might these institutions serve an agenda having nothing to do with the defunct ideals of their charters? Granted, this begins to sound like a conspiracy theory, but since the outsider&apos;s conspiracy is the in-group&apos;s action plan, I suggest that the idea needs <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#F23.1" class="fn">looking into.<span>
	This was good intuition when I wrote it. See &lsquo;The Powell Memorandum&rsquo; in Wikipedia for the origin of the action plan. Click for an obvious result.
</span></a> The question could be answered by following the money. The decay of investigative journalism means that this has not been done, but there is far too much money available to have come from $5 contributions. These think tanks do not stem from the grass roots of fundamentalism; they grow from &lsquo;<a class="fn">Astroturf&rsquo;.<span>
	A usage not yet in most dictionaries. <i>Grassroot</i> movements involve the common people considered as a fundamental politico-economic group; <i>Astroturf</i> movements are corporate imitations led by paid rabble-rousers and supported by anonymous contributions. The coal-billionaire Koch brothers are a principal support of the Astroturf Tea Party.
</span></a> The people who are paying think that they are good investments &mdash; yet venture capitalists do not show an interest in these institutions, so the expected ROI is not financial.
</p>

<p>About the only things that the 1&permil; lack &mdash; aside from conscience and an understanding of the cultural advantages of equality &mdash; are majority votes of their own. Traditional solutions, such as recruiting the dead (Lyndon Johnson 1948),  miscounting (Bush 2000, 2004), and straightforward purchase (<i>Citizens United</i> 2016), attract unfavorable attention, and more subtle methods are desirable. Fox News, electronic voting, talk shows, and conservative think tanks seem to be high on the list. Influence over the Bible Belt is a most tempting political target, not least because it is neither illegal nor plausibly made so by legislation. The question is how to achieve this efficiently and with the enthusiastic if misguided support of the people being manipulated. This question was in practice answered by the conservative response to the <a href="http://reclaimdemocracy.org/powell_memo_lewis/" class="fn">Powell Memorandum<span>
	Lewis Powell, later Supreme Court Justice, wrote the opinion in <i>First National Bank of Boston vs Bellotti</i> that gave corporations permission to influence ballot questions.
</span></a> of 1971-08-23 &mdash; which we will meet in <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#F23.1">Chapter 23</a> &mdash; and which led to an orchestrated long-term program of institutions and propaganda
intended to persuade the public that the corporation was their friend.

Evolution so threatens their self-image that they are not content to deny it in private, but need to go public, attacking evolution, the scientists who discovered it, and, apparently, anything else contaminated by the science that they dislike. Oddly, for many this includes <a href="http://www.cornwallalliance.org/2016/03/5925/">global heating</a> and other pro-environment issues, with a petition which advocates &lsquo;Forget <q>Climate Change</q>, Energy Empowers the Poor&rsquo; &mdash; an approach which (however charitable) appears realistic only to the completely innumerate. Fundamentalists&apos; anti-evolution has been carried to the extent of returning to the antiquated &lsquo;dominion theology&rsquo;, rejecting 2000 years of realistic rabbinical ecology in favor of the arrogant exploitive attitude toward nature that lies behind so many of our current problems, inclulding a theocratic &lsquo;biblical Christianity [that] will rule <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/dominion-theology.html">all areas of society</a>, personal and corporate&rsquo;.

<p class="epi">The paucity of intelligent life on Earth is an obvious refutation of Intelligent Design. Experience suggests that a functioning multifarious democracy requires a population mean IQ of 130. &mdash; B.F. Becula
</p>

<p>If there is anything sufficiently complicated and functional to appear designed, it is the complex machinery of active biomolecules. Consequently, an important focus of fundamentalist propaganda is a refurbishment of the intelligent-design interpretation epitomized by
William Paley&apos;s <cite>Natural Theology</cite> of 1802. However, this makes no advance on Cicero&apos;s presentation of 45 BCE, when he stated the case for the <a class="fn">Stoics:<span>
	MT Ciceronis (45 BCE) <cite>De Natura Deorum</cite> (On the Nature of the Gods), trans. Francis Brooks (Methuen, London, 1896): 2.38.

</p>

<blockquote>When we see a mechanism such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism#Known_gear_scheme" class="fn">planetary model<span>
	&dagger;He was thinking of the Antikythera mechanism, or something like it. Click for more.
</span></a> or a clock, do we doubt that it is the work of a conscious intelligence? So how can we doubt that the world is the work of divine intelligence?
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">Cicero continued, to describe a <a href="http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/" (as of 2013-11-05)>device</a>) &lsquo;recently constructed by our friend Posidonius, which at each revolution reproduces the same motions of the sun, the moon and the five planets&rsquo;.

	Cicero <span>{<cite>De Natura Deorum 1.8}

</blockquote>

<p>Curiously, supernaturalists never notice that Paley still used the clock example because ID had contributed nothing new since Cicero. In the meantime, methodological naturalism has described the actual tools and agents in great detail. The only thing we can do with supernaturalism is talk about it. (Tell me if you know of an application of supernaturalist principles that produced a useful invention, product, or repeatable cure.) Supernaturalism can provide an untestable answer for every question, but it is a conjecture without issue. (The efficacy of prayers and sacrifices lies in selective memory: good record-keeping would quickly erode faith.)

We will examine both sides &mdash; first the ID version, and then science&apos;s current best interpretation &mdash; of 3 main battlegrounds. The topics chosen may seem arcane, but this is because images of the Earth from space have so successfully trumped the stories of scripture that fundamentalists can no longer plausibly maintain the concept of a flat Earth. If they wish to undermine public comprehension of Science (seen as the chief opponent of Religion) they must move on to frontier areas where ideas are still in a state of ferment.

<p>The Discovery Institute is a creationist doublethink tank whose <cite>Five-Year Strategic-Plan Summary</cite> (intended to be complete a decade ago, by 2003) reads,
</p>

<blockquote>If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a wedge that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the thin edge of the wedge, was Phillip Johnson&apos;s critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in <cite>Darwinism on Trial</cite>, and continued in <cite>Reason in the Balance</cite> and <cite>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds</cite> [sic].

<p>The Anthropic Principle is an attempt to explain the apparent &lsquo;fine tuning&rsquo; of the universe. The laws of physics and the constants of nature allow the development of self-aware observers (ie, us). Change the laws or the constants, and the universe will not allow life as we know it to exist. Change the accidents of evolutionary history, and humans do not evolve. These facts led <a class="fn">
	John Barrow and Frank Tipler<span>(1996) <cite>The Anthropic Cosmological Principle</cite> (Oxford University Press, Oxford).
</span></a> to claim:
</p>

<ol>
<li>There exists one possible Universe &lsquo;designed&rsquo; with the goal of generating and sustaining &lsquo;observers&rsquo;;</li>

<li>Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being.</li>
</ol>

<p class="flu">This idea was immediately acclaimed by theologians, as noted in the section epigraph. We will see that this triumphalism was a bit premature.
</p>

<p>Statement 1 would be a platitude if &lsquo;possible&rsquo; were omitted, and &lsquo;“designed” with the goal&rsquo; replaced by &lsquo;capable&rsquo;. As it stands it means &lsquo;When imagination fails, we revert to superstition&rsquo;. In fact, there might be <a class="fn">40 billion<span>
	This is true despite suggestions that the Earth is uniquely habitable in the visible universe, because the <i>visible</i> universe on our light cone is much younger than the universe we would see if the speed of light were infinite. Planets &lsquo;currently&rsquo; uninhabited may develop life as they approach the age of the Earth.
</span></a> planets capable of supporting life as we know it, and an unknown of possibilities for other types of life. There are an infinite number of other universes, inaccessible to us, but as various and surprising as our own.
</p>

<p>Statement 2 is <b>Wheeler&apos;s</b> <a class="fn">Participatory Anthropic Principle<span>
	JA Wheeler (1983) &lsquo;Law without law&rsquo; In JA Wheeler & WH Zurek (eds.) <cite>Quantum Theory and Measurement</cite> (Princeton University Press): 182, 213.
</span></a> (PAP); in more detail, this reads:
</p>

<blockquote>[One version of] quantum theory states that any physical system remains in a superposed state of all possibilities until it interacts with the mind of an observer, suggest[ing] that as soon as an observer&apos;s mind makes contact with a superposed system, all the numerous possibilities collapse into one actuality. At some instant one of these possible alternative universes produced an observing lifeform &mdash; an animal with a nervous system which was sufficiently evolved to form a symbiotic association with a primordial mind. The first act of observation by this mind caused the entire superposed multiverse to collapse immediately into one of its numerous alternatives.
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds simultaneously scientific, anti-evolutionary and dualist, and is the &lsquo;overthrow of the random universe&rsquo; of the epigraph. Wheeler has indubitable credentials as a creative physicist, so his ideas deserve to be considered seriously. We all admit to not understanding QM, so we can ignore some of the mysteries here on the grounds that Wheeler may understand them very much better. Nevertheless, Wheeler&apos;s PAP raises awkward metaphysical problems concerning retrocausality, simultaneity, wave-function superposition, entanglement, decoherence and collapse, the meaning of &lsquo;observer&rsquo;, &lsquo;animal&rsquo;, and &lsquo;mind&rsquo;, and the definition of &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; prior to collapse. Alas, space does not permit pursuing these: Metaphysics may be entertaining, but it leads nowhere useful.

<p class="epi">Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability. &mdash; R.A. Fischer
</p>

<p class="epi">[T]here are many questions in philosophy which have not as yet been by any means satisfactorily cleared up&hellip; &mdash; Cicero, <cite>De Natura Deorum</cite>.
</p>

<p>Since neither proteins nor the DNA of any organism were assembled by chance, creationists claim that ID is the only alternative. The desperation of this claim has increased as our knowledge of molecular biology has increased. A chapter by <a class="fn">Stephen Meyer<span>
	SC Meyer (2003) &lsquo;DNA and the Origin of Life: Information, Specification, and Explanation&rsquo; in JA Campbell, SC Meyer (eds.) <cite>Darwinism, Design and Public Education</cite> (Michigan State University Press, Ann Arbor).
</span></a> is typical of the genre. Meyer is a heavyweight in the ID debate, being a Cambridge-University-trained philosopher of science. But I have yet to see the word &lsquo;endosymbiosis&rsquo; in his writing, which means that his grasp of the possibilities of evolution is sharply limited.
</p>

<p>He treats 4 possible explanations of the &lsquo;complexity and specificity&rsquo; of living organisms: Chance, Necessity (=chemical affinity), their Combination, and Design. Despite his background, his discussion is self-contradictory, first dismissing the possibility of prebiotic natural selection as a &lsquo;contradiction in terms&rsquo; &mdash; but it is only chemical kinetics, with some reactions occurring faster than others &mdash; and then overlooking it (claiming that replicators will not always copy exactly, so they will decay &mdash; but this <i>is</i> natural selection: the working ones survive, the failures are recycled).
</p>

<p>Meyer worries about specific &lsquo;information in the bio-macromolecules necessary to life&rsquo; &mdash; that is, genetic information in DNA &mdash; and infers, &lsquo;based upon our present knowledge of established cause-effect relationships, that an intelligent cause operated in the past to produce the specified information necessary to the origin of life&rsquo;. The burden of his paper is that since the scientific method (&lsquo;methodological naturalism&rsquo;) has not yet described the origin of life, it is time for unmethodical supernaturalism to be re-admitted to the pale of respectability, because &lsquo;recognizing the activity of intelligent agents constitutes a common and fully rational mode of inference&rsquo;, citing <a class="fn">Dembski<span>
	WA Dembski (1998) <cite>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance Through Small Probabilities</cite> (Cambridge University Press).
<br>--------------------------<br>
	This approach is acceptable only to medieval minds and 4-year-olds, since it immediately requires evading an infinite regression. We explain ourselves (complex intelligent agents) by postulating our design by a more complex, more intelligent agent. What designed the more complex, more intelligent agent? &lsquo;Oh, it was self-generated.&rsquo; &lsquo;But a designer is necessarily more complex (in some sense) than what he designs. If a complex god can be self-generated, why can&apos;t the simpler universe be self-generated?&rsquo;
</span></a> (An appropriate way to advocate readmission would be to show something &mdash; anything &mdash; that supernaturalism has contributed in the 2500 years since Diagoras Atheos of Melos observed that we didn&apos;t need it.)
</p>

<p>Part of Meyer&apos;s problem is evident from his title, &lsquo;DNA and the Origin of Life&rsquo;, because DNA was not present at the origin of life. There were 200 million years or more in which information was carried by something else, perhaps RNA toward the end of the period. The earliest traces of &lsquo;life&rsquo; are not fossil forms, but changes in carbon-isotope ratios that indicate kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control of reactions. (It takes time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium &mdash; theoretically, infinite time, in practice, longer than organisms can devote to lunch. Isotopic disequilibrium often means that some organism was preferentially selecting light-weight, fast-reacting isotopes for his chemical reactions.) Such &lsquo;life&rsquo; was too simple to leave more informative spoor, so at present we can only construct imaginative hypotheses about its details. The conservative mindset is not known for imagination, and ID types find it more comforting to resort to millennial traditions of magic.
</p>

<p>It was during this prebiotic period that Meyer&apos;s &lsquo;intelligent cause&rsquo; was operative, and it was continuous with the same error-and-trial responsible for all the rest of evolution. What Meyer overlooks is that we can point to <i>natural</i> intelligent agents, but <i>supernatural</i> agents are members of the set of djinns and unicorns. We can tell entertaining stories about them, but real djinns turn out to be small tornados, and unicorn horns come from narwhals.

<p>If this well funded, century-long effort to keep people ignorant has a financial goal, it is not obvious. It has been politicized by the Republican party, but this is only a sort of kindred opportunism. Its roots seem to be pothodoxy (the urge to believe a particular creation myth that strokes their egos) and Instinct-1, since the myth in its Neolithic form is replete with alpha-male chest thumping.

</p>

<p>ID itself (neglecting the nature of the Designer) is a legitimate hypothesis, because it can be falsified by the first redesign of a working enzyme, equalling its efficiency with fewer components. (To any competent engineer, this would convincingly demonstrate that the evolutionary product had not been planned by an omniscient, omnipotent Designer.) This is not an easy challenge, because protein folding is so computation-intensive that it is one of the &lsquo;xxx@Home&rsquo; projects passed out to volunteers on the web. In practice folding often requires assistance from &lsquo;chaperone&rsquo; molecules to ensure the correct configuration. Even working proteins sometimes fold the wrong way, as in mad-cow disease. Nevertheless, such redesign will eventually be done as computer power increases. When we can improve upon a single existing molecule, it will radically change the nature of the debate.
</p>

<p>The principal alternative explanation for the apparent fine tuning is the &lsquo;ensemble hypothesis&rsquo; of multiple independent universes in a multiverse. For our purposes, think of this as a variant of the Student Goddesses&rsquo; project. The point is that there is nothing known to prevent the existence of the multiverse, and nothing to prevent each universe from having a different &lsquo;tuning&rsquo;. We live in a universe whose tuning permits life as we know it.

<a class="tri" href="#11">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p> A better name for the Anthropic Principle described by Barrow and Tipler is the &lsquo;Anthropo<i>centric</i> Principle&rsquo;. It is the centerpiece of Middle Eastern theology (Genesis 1:26 &lsquo;Let us make man in our image&rsquo;) and Western philosophy (Protagoras: &lsquo;Man is the measure of all things&rsquo;). In time it extends from the Paleolithic to today (&lsquo;How many Harvard students does it take to change a <a class="fn">light bulb?&rsquo;).<span>
	One. He holds the bulb and the universe revolves around him.
</span></a> It strokes our egos in a way that nothing else can approach. This in itself is sufficient to make the idea suspect.
</p>

<p>Nearly 3 dozen pithy sentences have been put forward as Anthropic Principles, and given acronyms like Strong (SAP) and Weak (WAP) and Somewhat Weak (SWAP). The Final (FAP) said:
</p>

<blockquote>Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">Martin Gardner sagely suggested this one should be renamed the Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP). (If it were true, its most probable interpretation would be that we are not the intelligent information-processors after all.)
</p>

<p>Cosmologist <a class="fn">Brandon Carter<span>
	B Carter (1974) &lsquo;Large number coincidences and the anthropic principle in cosmology&rsquo; in MS Longair <cite>Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Data</cite> (Reidel, Dordrecht) 291&ndash;298.)
</span></a> coined the term &lsquo;<a class="fn">anthropic principle&rsquo;,<span>
	And considering the confusion it has caused, he later wished he had given it a different name.
</span></a> so he gets the last word on the appropriate formulation, which turns out to be non-mysterious and common-sensical:
</p>

<blockquote>[W]hat we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary for our presence as observers&rsquo;.
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">This reduced the Anthropic Principle to a simple tautology, but it did not stop postmodern maundering. <a class="fn">Nick Bostrom<span>
	N Bostrom (2002) <cite>Anthropic Bias Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy</cite>  (Routledge, NY &amp; London): Ch. 2.

	VJ Stenger (1995) <cite>The Unconscious Quantum: Metaphysics in Modern Physics and Cosmology</cite> (Prometheus Books, Amherst NYC).
</span></a> got fed up with people marveling at the appearance of fine tuning, so he wrote a little computer program called MonkeyGod. MonkeyGod assigns random values to 4 of the critical <b>physical</b> parameters &mdash; the ones that cannot vary by as much as a factor of 2 and still permit life <a class="fn">as we know it.<span>
	The fine structure constant, the strong-interaction strength at low energy, the mass of the electron, and the mass of the proton.
</span></a> From these, Stenger made order-of-magnitude estimates of such things as the mean lifetime of stars and the size of planets. Life as we know it cannot appear in most of MonkeyGod&apos;s universes &mdash; but life as we don&apos;t know it seems to be possible over ±5 orders of magnitude for the &lsquo;magic numbers&rsquo;. The stars live long enough, and complex structures are possible. Some structures are autocatalytic &mdash; and we have the first characteristic of life, reproduction. The others will soon follow. 10 orders of magnitude is not fine tuning by any stretch of the imagination. Inhabitants who find a universe fine tuned to their needs do so precisely because they evolved in it.

<p>Hindu theology came to similar conclusions long ago. In the <cite>Srinad Bhaghavatam</cite>, Krishna generates many universes &lsquo;from the pores of his skin&rsquo;, as in Fig. 17.1. There is no reason why the laws of physics should be uniform across these universes. Krishna is known for his love of diversity, so why would he made 2 universes alike? Did not Jesus say &lsquo;In my Father&apos;s house are many mansions&rsquo; {John 14:2}?

<p>Looking back at the <a href="#06">Anthropic Principle</a>, one hates to rain on Wheeler&apos;s parade, but there is an alternative to the Participatory Anthropic Principle. PAP starts off with &lsquo;[One version of] quantum theory states that any physical system remains in a superposed state of all possibilities until it interacts with &hellip;&rsquo; &mdash; and at this point PAP suggests, &lsquo; an <i>observer</i>&rsquo;, which is the Copenhagen consensus. A less restrictive alternative suggests interaction with &lsquo;the <i>environment</i>&rsquo; &mdash; a commonplace process devoid of paradoxes and any need for &lsquo;intelligent observers&rsquo; to bring the universe into existence. Ockham&apos;s Razor is clear on which of these to prefer!
</p>

<p>Interacting with the environment leads to quantum decoherence, or loss of entanglement between the components of a system in a superposed quantum state. The major consequence of decoherence is the classical behavior that we normally observe, but it takes several pages of quantum algebra to show this.
</p>

<p>Consider a macroscopic system such as <a class="fn">Schrödinger&apos;s cat,<span>
	The cat is put in a closed box, with a slow radioactive source, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of cyanide. If the counter registers a hit, the hammer drops, the vial is broken, and the cat dies. (I cannot account for the ailurophobia of the Copenhagen group, but there it is). Seeking a necessary role for humanity in the universe, it occurred to them that since <i>they</i> didn&apos;t know the state of the cat until they opened the box and observed it, it must be that their observation was the essential step that &lsquo;collapsed&rsquo; the possible wave functions of the dead/alive cat. (And why wasn&apos;t the cat a sufficient observer of her own state?  The many cats I have known kept track of such matters!)
</span></a> existing (at least in the minds of the assembled Copenhagen quantum mechanics) in a limbo of superposed &lsquo;dead&rsquo; and &lsquo;alive&rsquo; quantum states until they open the box and observe the result. In the real world the cat continuously interacts with a host of small systems, such as photons and air molecules. Each interaction reduces the coherence, eventually leaving an incoherent mixture at the thermodynamic ratio of probabilities (there is always a small probability that the cat will die of natural causes, rather than cyanide, while in the box). The result is that the cat is in a classical state at all times.
</p>

<p>Decoherence by interaction with the environment is effectively instantaneous, since the number of such interactions is astronomically large. In short, the mysterious &lsquo;wave function collapse&rsquo; that occurs in the Copenhagen interpretation when an observe records a measurement is replaced by a normal, continuous decoherence interaction with the environment. With a little more algebra, it turns out that collision with a single <a class="fn">molecule,<span>

</span></a> is sufficient to cause decoherence, and the astronomical numbers are not needed. (This does not preclude the survival of coherence in an <i>isolated</i> system (as in quantum computing, where the problem is to maintain coherence long enough for practical use. A few microseconds would be handy.)
</p>

<p> The concept to carry away from this section is that the universe seems capable of coming into existence without our help. We are not yet particularly important in the grand scheme of things. The conceit was excusable in 2000 BCE, but it seems a little arrogant when we realize that we are one <img class="im" src="../Images/K-TakeHome3.gif" alt="TakeHome">species among 10 million, on one planet among 100,000,000,000 galaxies with 100,000,000,000 stars each, in one of a possibly <i>very</i> large number of universes.

<p class="epi">Observation suggests that fundamentalists learned to distrust human reason by trying their version of it.
</p>

<p>The classic example of ID confusion is that the eye is irreducibly complex. Darwin predicted this opinion, and explained why it was wrong, yet 150 years later creationists are still saying, &lsquo;Start with a completely developed, fully functioning eye (<i>the only kind that has ever been found!</i>) and work backward a couple of evolutionary steps and you will see why Darwin was so candid.&rsquo; The errors here are basic: ignorance about biology &mdash; the italicized phrase is simply false &mdash; , and selective reading, because Darwin&apos;s next sentence is:
</p>

<blockquote>Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certain the case; &hellip; then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, should not be considered as subversive of the theory. &mdash; <a class="fn">Darwin<span>
	C Darwin (1872) <cite>The Origin of Species</cite> (Senate, London): Ch. 6.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>He then described the &lsquo;numerous gradations&rsquo; from patches of light-sensitive skin to &lsquo;camera eyes&rsquo; with focus, aperture, and retina. A feature of scientific method that creationists seem unable to grasp is that <i>if the predicted gradations had been absent</i>, evolutionary theory would have been falsified and fallen from favor. Instead, biologists found Darwin&apos;s complete sequence &mdash; not once, but <a class="fn">4 times:<span>
	VJ Martin (2002) &lsquo;Photoreceptors of cnidarians&rsquo; <cite>Can. J. Zool.</cite> <b>80</b>(#10): 1703&ndash;1722.
</span></a> in snails, molluscs, annelids, and cnidarians (jellyfish and corals), the latter in a group where even nerves are in short supply and any eye at all is unexpected. (Our eyes developed from those of annelids.)
</p>

<p>Both sides are claiming Sherlock&apos;s principle, &lsquo;After eliminating the impossible, what remains must be true, no matter how improbable.&rsquo; Darwin and the scientists think that magic is impossible because neither in theory nor practice can it be shown to work; the creationists think that variation and selection are impossible because the Bible didn&apos;t mention them. The test is that we can watch variation and selection at work, but no creationist has yet demonstrated magic. Creationists still ask, &lsquo;What good is 5% of an eye?&rsquo; Richard Dawkins cited Erasmus: &lsquo;In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king&rsquo;. 5% of 20/20 vision is very much better than 0%. Stephen Jay Gould followed Darwin in suggesting parts of the eye might have developed for other purposes. This is true for, e.g., opsin, the light-sensitive molecule of eyes, which began life as a transmembrane pore. It is true for eye lenses, because a critical feature is the radial refractive-index gradient. This gradient is dictated by the laws of optics if you want sharp focus. Since many proteins will work, different organisms co-opt different existing proteins.
</p>

<p>Some single-celled marine protoctists have an eye with a lens, because they need this much &mdash; and no more &mdash; for diel migration. Diel migrators spend their days below the photic zone, where little light penetrates and they can keep out of sight. This also allows phytoplankton (one-celled marine &lsquo;grass&rsquo;) to multiply exponentially all day. When the migrators&rsquo; 5% of an eye tells them it is dark, they rise to the surface to graze. ID people fret about the need for a complex nervous system to accompany the eye. But diel migrators do not need to think. The ones who don&apos;t migrate either get eaten at the surface in daytime, or find less food at depth and reproduce slowly.

<p>Simple eyes need only simple support systems. Certain jellyfish larva have only 5 cell types, one of which, shown in Fig. 17.2, has an undulipodium with its own eye, combining sensor and motive system in a single cell. No neurons needed.

<p>Other single-celled organisms have mobile internal parasols to shade the nucleus from ultraviolet damage. We ourselves have at least 3 light-sensitive organs, one of which &mdash; skin &mdash; serves this same purpose. Skin is slow to tan, but it develops protective melanin, and in 30 generations natural selection will turn us naturally tanned at birth. Skin shows sensitivity, response, and room for improvement. In short, bare human skin is already 2% of an eye &mdash; and the 2% is useful. Many parts of the brain, including the clock that controls our circadian rhythm, are responsive to light. The suicidal depression of Norwegians in Tromsø winters can be cured by periodic doses of artificial sunlight, apparently a response of the pineal gland. There are, in short, many important uses for &lsquo;fractional eyes&rsquo;. Climbing vines, whose &lsquo;eye&rsquo; is chlorophyll distributed throughout their leaves, grow toward the darkest direction available, hoping it is a tree shading the sky.

<p>&hellip; of the Time for an Eye to Evolve&rsquo; is the title of a <a class="fn">classic paper<span>
	DE Nilsson, S Pelger (1994) &lsquo;A Pessimistic Estimate of the Time Required for an Eye to Evolve&rsquo; <cite>Roy. Soc. London Proc: Biological Sciences</cite><b> B245</b>(#1345): 53&ndash;58.
</span></a> which demonstrates how quickly evolution could produce an eye. It is a stepwise development of a fish-like eye in 1% increments, following Darwin&apos;s recipe. There are 8 diagrams of intermediate steps, each having biological examples. The human embryonic eye goes through similar steps, recalling Haeckel&apos;s dictum &lsquo;ontogeny [fetal development] recapitulates phylogeny [evolutionary history]&rsquo;. To go from a light-sensitive flat spot to a camera-eye requires <a class="fn">1829 1% steps.<span>
	Doubling a diameter in 1% steps, for instance, requires 70 steps, because 2 = 1.01<sup>70</sup>.
</span></a> The model works serially, one process at a time; natural selection would be faster, operating on all processes simultaneously. The authors suggest that the steps they outline could, using a conservative value for heritability, occur sequentially in 364,000 generations (a 1% step every 200 generations) &mdash; and much faster in parallel. (If selection did not always occur on schedule, perhaps increasing the required time by a factor of 10, this is still &lsquo;instantaneous&rsquo; in the geological record.)
</p>

<p>The response of creationists to this paper has been inept complaints. Deliberately or uncomprehendingly, they miss the point and misrepresent the argument. Because their goal is to denigrate science, their responses are published in the popular press. The few creationists who can understand the &lsquo;pessimistic estimate&rsquo; paper fall back on the God of Narrower Gaps. Dismissing the conversion of photosensitive skin into an eye, they say that they meant that the <i>photoreceptor</i> was irreducibly complex and required divine intervention. Figure 17.3 shows photoreceptors found in early organisms. The variety suggests that either the designer was wildly unsure of the best design, each taxonomic class had its <a class="fn">own designer,<span>
	And why not? Nothing in the logic of ID precludes a team of design specialists.
</span></a> or photoreceptors, like eyes, evolve rather easily. Much the same logic applies at the molecular level, where there are 2 related detection systems.

<p>Instead of showing once again that creationist calculations are erroneous, let me try <a class="fn"><i>reductio ad absurdum.</i><span>
	I realize that this is futile, since creationists seem incapable of recognizing an absurdity when they calculate one themselves. But it is <i>fun</i>.
</span></a> William <a class="fn">Dembski,<span>
	WA Dembski (1998) <cite>The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance Through Small Probabilities</cite> (Cambridge University Press): 175&ndash;223.

	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Arithmetic3.gif" alt="Arithmetic"></a>
<a class="fn">
	Emil Borel,<span>E Borel (1962) <cite>Probabilities and Life</cite>, trans. M. Baudin (Dover, NYC): 28.
</span></a> maintains that a probability of 10<sup>&ndash;150</sup> is grounds for invoking Intelligent Design. Let us see.
</p>

<p>There is a commonplace event which, <i>when calculated à la creationism</i>, has a probability of
</p>

<p class="cen">10<sup>&ndash;660,000,000,000,000,000,000</sup>.
</p>

<p class="flu">That's one chance in 1 followed by 660 quintillion zeroes &mdash; for something you may have watched within the week.
</p>

<p>We are going to build a molecular object, <i>much</i> simpler than DNA, by chance, using creationist logic. Consider a 1 meter cube, with a volume of 1e30 cubic <a class="fn">Ångstroms<span>
	The notation 1e30 is a way to enter 1x10<sup>30</sup>=1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 gracefully on a keyboard. The &lsquo;e&rsquo; means &lsquo;exponent&rsquo; and the 10 is understood. An Ångstrom is 10<sup>-10</sup> m, or 0.1 nanometer, not official SI, but the right size for atoms.
</span></a>. The molecules we will work with are 2x4x40 Å, or 320 Å<sup>3</sup>, and all alike. Our cube can hold 3.1e27 such molecules. We need <i>n</i> = 7.9e19 molecules in the correct positions and orientations to make our metastable object.
</p>

<p>We start by placing molecules in random locations. The probability <i>p</i> of getting a molecule in a correct box is (7.9e19 correct-boxes / 3.1e27 total-boxes), whence <i>p</i> = 2.5e&ndash;8. Orientation effects reduce the success rate of each placement by a factor of 6, so <i>p</i> = 4.2e&ndash;9. The probability of <i>n</i> successive independent random events is the product of their separate probabilities, or <i>p<sup>n</sup></i> = (4.2e-9)^(7.9e19). (We should subtract a box every time we fill one, but the correction is insignificant.)
</p>

<p>Computers cannot deal with numbers this size directly, so we convert to logarithms:
</p>

<p class="cen">
Log <i>p<sup>n</sup></i> = <i>n</i> Log <i>p</i> = (7.9e19)·(&ndash;8.4) = &ndash;6.6e20, and back again:<br>
<i>p<sup>n</sup></i> = 10<sup>Log <i>p<sup>n</sup></i></sup> = 10<sup>&ndash;6.6·10<sup>20</sup></sup> = 10<sup>&ndash;660,000,000,000,000,000,000</sup>.
</p>

<p>This ridiculous number is the chance of producing a particular shape by inserting molecules at random. There are no hidden assumptions or trickery &mdash; yet I watched a young lady in the Sunday market make such objects by the dozen to amuse small children. Dip a rope loop in soap solution, wave the loop &mdash; and floating bubbles up to a meter in diameter appear, each of them astronomically more improbable than anything a creationist ever <a class="fn">miscalculated.<span>
	Of course I have cheated a bit here. The soap bubble need not be a perfect sphere. In fact, as it grows, it takes on the shapes of a lumpy bag. Sufficiently small holes (a missing molecule, for instance) will heal by surface tension. But this is less cheating than the creationists do when they overlook a billion years of evolution!
</span></a>
</p>

<p>The problem with creationist calculations is that they assume that biological molecules were assembled by chance. This is wrong. Small molecules are created by chemistry; many medium-sized molecules are the unavoidable product of the reaction of smaller molecules; large molecules may be polymerized by the repetition of a simple reaction. Some structures self-assemble. Early life made do with smaller molecules and simpler systems than we find today. The &lsquo;Intelligent Designer&rsquo; at work here is either the Schrödinger Equation which governs quantum chemistry, or the vicissitudes of life, picking and choosing chemical systems that will leave the most descendants.
</p>

<p>Asking where the Schrödinger Equation came from is a legitimate theological question, but I have never heard a fundamentalist ask it. Certainly Schrödinger invented it, and it may be only a approximation to the true equation, but it remains our most accurate description of the world and it was at work before the Big Bang. Why? How?

<p>For all we know, there may be an Intelligent Designer. If there is, the hard questions &mdash; which are an order of magnitude more difficult than the ones we are working on &mdash; are these:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Who designed the <a class="fn">Designer?<span>
	If the designer is said to be &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; (uncreated), rather than &lsquo;contingent&rsquo; (created), why cannot the universe itself be &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;? This presents a <i>much</i> simpler problem!
</span></a></li>

<li>Why?</li>

<li>Why has she so often done such a rotten job?</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">Meanwhile, lacking any obvious way of asking these questions, evolutionary biologists tackled the easier question of &lsquo;How did the Designer do it?&rsquo;
</p>

	D Batten (NoDate) &lsquo;15 Questions for Evolutionists&rsquo; [Click for more.]

<p>If your answer to the first question is that life originated by divine magic, and you find that satisfactory, well and good. &lsquo;We&rsquo;, (the evolutionary biologists, taxonomists, biochemists, information technologists, paleontologists, ethicists, psychologists, cosmologists, etc.) want to know more about the details. Since the details are incredibly abundant and technical, they require more time and effort. A fair division of teaching time would be proportional to the number of disciplines involved, or 9:1 for the list above. Being generous, we will settle for the traditional 5:1. We teach evolution, cladistics, molecular biology, vector calculus, population genetics and their ilk 5 days of the week; Creationists teach whichever of the 3500 creation myths they prefer on one day; everyone goofs off on the leftover day.

<p>Wedgeman William Dembski maintains that

<blockquote>Materialistic ideology has subverted the study of biological and cosmological origins so that the actual content of these sciences has become corrupted. The problem, therefore, is not merely that science is being used illegitimately to promote a materialistic worldview, but that this worldview is actively undermining scientific inquiry, leading to incorrect and unsupported conclusions about biological and cosmological origins. &mdash; <cite>Uncommon Descent</cite> blog (2006-06-15)
</blockquote>

<p>Without some examples of the &lsquo;incorrect conclusions&rsquo; it is impossible to guess what Dembski is talking about. It appears to be empty inflammatory rhetoric whose message is that of frustrated ego: &lsquo;If Adam was not personally handcrafted by an anthropomorphic god, I am descended from an ape. This is unbearable! I demand satisfaction! My sword measures 92 cm.&rsquo; &mdash; to which the only useful reply is, &lsquo;But I have the choice of weapons. Cream pies at 3 paces.&rsquo;

<p>The initial impulse behind the efforts of Linnaeus (and scores of medieval monks) to organize the world of biology into a Tree of Life, was to understand and magnify the plenitude of god, whose specially created &lsquo;7 kinds&rsquo; had manifestly become 10,000 or more non-interbreeding species. Genesis described something that was obviously incomplete when ecosystems other than the Middle Eastern desert were included, so what was going on? The more they learned about taxonomy, the less relevant special creation became, and the more apparent became a different sort of order, organization, and process. It short, it wasn&apos;t materialistic ideology that subverted biology, but biology that subverted supernatural belief in a literal Genesis. The question became how god had created life if the story in Genesis was poetical rather than factual.
</p>

<p>Creationists seem terminally confused about the relation between mutation and speciation, claiming that mutations are always deleterious. In fact, a mutation can be advantageous in one environment and deleterious in another; examples are <a href="#19a">CCR5</a> and <a href="../_E/E18.shtml#12">sickle-cell. </a> Many mutations are silent, occurring in the 3rd (redundant) codon, and change nothing; many more change a purely structural amino acid, leaving the molecule functionally unchanged. Each of us carries some <a class="fn">175 new mutations<span>
	MW Nachman, SL Crowell (2000) &lsquo;Estimate of the Mutation Rate per Nucleotide in Humans&rsquo; <cite>Genetics</cite> <b>156</b>: 297-304.
</span></a> that mark us as unique individuals.
</p>

<p>Creationists claim that no one has ever seen a new species appear, and talk of a &lsquo;species barrier&rsquo; that limits the possibility of change by <a class="fn">selection.<span>
	There are &lsquo;hybridization barriers&rsquo; which limit cross-breeding of closely related species, exemplified by the incompatible sexual organs of Malagache lemur species. This may be only the result of genetic drift. Lions and tigers, horses and donkeys, dogs and wolves, grizzlies and polar bears, all produce hybrids, often with lowered fertility. This is mostly a matter of how well the parental chromosomes match during cell division and cross-over: too many differences (ie, humans and chimpanzees), and hybridization fails.<br>
	However, any good genetic modification lab should be able to produce an <i>in vitro</i> human-chimp hybrid by tinkering with human chromosome 2.
</span></a> What they describe is a limited number of existing alleles available for selection within a species. We saw <a href="../_A/A00.shtml#07">earlier</a> that there are a number of ways of forming new species by rare genetic processes. In any case, plant breeders have created numerous new species by chromosome doubling. Coffee species with 22, 44, 66, and 88 chromosomes occur naturally, and apple, banana, and cotton genera (among others) include similar polyploid species. Plant breeders often induce polyploidy with colchicine to create showier or sturdier garden plants.</p>

<p>While the details of the earliest self-reproducing system may never be known, there are some relevant aspects of early biochemistry that seem to have escaped notice by wedgies. The passage from <cite>Uncommon Descent</cite> quoted above accompanied a press release from UC Berkeley describing work on ATP synthase, a critical enzyme in the chemical-energy conversion that powers life. Dembski&apos;s associated question was
</p>

<blockquote>ask yourself what contribution, if any, conventional evolutionary theory is making to the study of these biochemical systems.
</blockquote>

<p>The answer (below) was provided by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster, <i>30 years earlier</i>, showing that Dembski either had not done his homework, or flatly failed to understand one of the classic trilogies of biology.

<p class="epi">The regularities in the build up of this very complex [molecular] structure [of the cell] leave no doubt, that the first living cell must itself have been the product of a protracted process of evolution which had to involve many single, but not necessarily singular, steps. &mdash; <a class="fn">

<p>Intelligent Design&apos;s major problem is a mistaken time perspective. When it looks at a complex product of several billion years of tinker-and-test, it correctly perceives that it could not have been produced by any single natural event. Limited to the short time scale of the Bible, ID perforce falls back on a singular supernatural event instead of a series of natural ones.
</p>

<p>Today&apos;s highy evolved bacteria and 300-amino-acid protein molecules are slightly improved modifications of last year's less-evolved bacteria and 299-amino-acid molecules. If we follow this top-down logic backwards in time, eventually the bacterium no longer looks like a bacterium, and the molecule no longer looks like a protein. It seems reasonable that one should be able to do this experimentally, reversing evolutionary steps until we arrive at the starting configuration. Unfortunately, &lsquo;reverse evolution&rsquo; is just as complicated as forward evolution, with too many possibilities, and too many dead ends, for laboratory experiments to be productive. Scientists have neither the possibility of running the myriad parallel experiments, nor the millions of years to test them, that life had on the way up.
</p>

<p>Bottom-up experiments are somewhat simpler, but a look at the possible starting points of <a href="#F17.4">Fig. 17.4</a> will suggest that this approach is not an easy one either.
</p>

<p>A key insight is that we are looking for compounds that self-assemble, such as adenine, a component of DNA made from 5 HCN molecules (hydrogen cyanide, present in interstellar gas clouds). We are looking for autocatalytic reactions in which a molecule <a class="fn">reproduces itself<span>
	S Kauffman (1995) <cite>At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity</cite> (Oxford University Press).
</span></a> in the presence of the right substrate. We are looking for systems of mutual catalysis, in which different molecules cooperate to reproduce eachother.
</p>

<p>A &lsquo;hypercycle&rsquo; is a closed loop of cooperative reactions in which information in the loop is added to inputs and exported repetitively to the environment. <a class="fn">Eigen and Schuster<span>

</p>

<ol>
<li>In the early phases of evolution, characterized by low fidelities of replication and translation as well as by the initially low abundance of efficiently replicating units, hypercyclic organization offers large relative advantages over any other kind of (structural) organization, and</li>

<li>Hypercyclic models can indeed be built to provide realistic precursors of the reproduction and translation apparatus found in present prokaryotic cells.</li>
</ol>

<p>The &lsquo;early phase of evolution&rsquo; considered here implies the availability of relatively complex organic building blocks are available. As an example of what these might have been, Fig. 17.4 shows one class of compounds from one solvent extraction of a 30-mg sample of the Murchison meteorite.

Prebiotic organics. Over 500 different <i>classes</i> of nitrogen-and-sulfur-containing organics were extracted from the Murchison meteorite by methanol (different collections are extracted by other solvents). Each line (except the tall ones, which are terrestrial contamination) is a <i>set</i> of compounds formed before arrival on earth. The modal value, near 280, represents a molecule containing about 18 atoms per charge, (not counting hydrogens), and 40 atoms at the far right. The smoothness of the envelope is probably a result of millennial sorting by boiling point in the protosun’s temperature field.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>In the absence of life and free oxygen, the ocean would have been rich in organic compounds, both in solution and floating on top, perhaps in a layer 10 meters thick. If this quantity, and variety, of organic chemicals is not enough to produce self-replicating structures, solar ultraviolet was not yet blocked by the ozone layer, and would have provided energy for additional chemical reactions, leading to more compounds, and more complex compounds, than the starting mix of Fig. 17.4. Deep circulation would bring organics into contact with hot vents at spreading centers, and a whole new suite of reaction possibilities. Seawater circulates deep in the fractured basaltic rocks of mid-ocean ridges, reaching high temperatures and pressures and a variety of potentially catalytic surfaces.
</p>

<p>In addition, it has recently <a class="fn">been realized<span>
	F Tian &amp;3a (2005) &lsquo;A Hydrogen-Rich Early Earth Atmosphere&rsquo; <cite>Science</cite> <b>308</b>: 1014&ndash;1017.
</span></a> that the temperature distribution of the early atmosphere was such that the ground-level composition was 30% hydrogen. This means that the rate of synthesis of prebiotic precursors was as much as 1000-fold greater than earlier predictions, so that &lsquo;the organic soup in the ocean and ponds of the early Earth would have been more favorable place for the origin of life than previously thought&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>500 million years of this would create nearly anything you might want &mdash; including, inevitably, self-reproducing structures of various kinds. Figuring out the earliest precursors of life is difficult simply because the number of candidate systems is, in any practical sense, infinite.

<a class="tri" href="#18">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Soap bubbles, which self assemble, are directly related to the origin of life, since a (tiny) bubble is a realistic model of a primordial cell membrane, both being bilayer lipids. Soap, whose hydrophilic (water-loving) end is electrically charged, is a bit too soluble for permanance in water, but protected in glass cases, planar bilayer films of soap are stable for years. (The air inside spherical soap bubbles is at higher pressure than outside by twice the surface tension of the soap, so it gradually diffuses out). Any spherical lipid film in the early ocean would collect insoluble surfactants, increasing its durability, until it enclosed an isolated compartment in which reactions would be largely independent of what was going on outside.
</p>

<p>If you agitate a solution containing molecules suitable for cell membranes, you find tiny spheres by the thousand, requiring no more ID than a breaking wave. They contain whatever solution they were formed in, thus providing a continuous supply of independent, isolated biochemical systems. Protolife biochemists thus envision a world with tiny laboratories as numberless as the bubbles in ocean whitecaps, each containing a different selection of reactive organics, each surrounded by a slightly different membrane. Some membranes would include patches that were porous to specific small molecules.
</p>

<p>All of this is natural and inevitable. Also inevitable is that sooner or later one of the systems would reproduce itself &mdash; and that is all it takes.
</p>

<p>The ability of certain molecules to self assemble under certain conditions might be an aspect of ID. There is no way to tell. But if it were, the &lsquo;thing&rsquo; that was designed was Schrödinger&apos;s equation, not mentioned by any creationist I have read: no miracles, nothing special, just a scientific law expressible as a differential equation.
</p>

<p>There are 3 concepts to carry away from this section:
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-TakeHome3.gif" alt="TakeHome"></a>
</p>

<ol>
<li>The laws of nature allow molecular self assembly, so a child blowing a soap bubble does not need divine intervention;</li>

<li>There have been 2 routes toward understanding creation. The approach of Stoics and wedgemen leads nowhere. Anyone espousing these arguments since the Bronze Age was wasting his time (intellectually, if not politically). Today&apos;s many pseudo-scientific creationist organizations have contributed nothing but FUD in <a class="fn">half a century.<span>
	&lsquo;The sabotage of science is now a routine part of American politics.&rsquo; &mdash; and, I would add, a particularly stupid and short-sighted one, all by ignorant MBAs who pride themselves on their expensive education, power suits, and business acumen!
<br>--------------<br>
	D Michaels (2013) <cite>Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health</cite> (Oxford).
</span></a>
</li>

<li>The approach of Lucretian experimentalists leads to increased understanding. A human contains 60&ndash;100 trillion spheroidal molecular-bilayer shells (the adult version of soap bubbles, as it were). What we know about them we owe to Avogadro, Boltzmann, Gibbs, Schrödinger, van der Waals, and their ilk. Knowing about them is important, because children who do not get the right molecules in their diet cannot make new brain-cell membranes on the 1-minute scale of new learning, leading to attention-deficit disorder, hyperactivity, and inevitably, under-educated adults who believe in supernaturalism. It was not scatter-brained wedgemen who discovered this, but methodological naturalists.

It is now enclosed in mitochondria, organelles that are nearly ubiquitous in the cells of oxygen breathers. Once upon a time, the mitochondrion was a free-living bacterium, captured by something which had hoped to eat it, but found it indigestible. We know this because it still retains its original enclosing membrane, different from that of its hosts, and because it has lost all of its genome except the parts necessary to assemble the tools it needs to run the cycle.

Green-colored carbons will be released as CO₂ in the next step. Run counter-clockwise, it synthesizes pyruvate from 3 CO₂ molecules, an approach much in vogue before the invention of photosynthesis.

However, CCR5-Δ32 does not protect us from other pathogens which CCR5 keeps out. As one who has made a living as an industrial designer, I have trouble finding a rationale for designing a system which protects us from one killer by making us vulnerable to another.

<p>A key element in the acceptance of a hypothesis is the reliability of its predictions. It is hard to imagine what sort of prediction an advocate of ID might make, so I won&apos;t try. It is easy to find verified predictions made from evolutionary theory. Consider the hypothesis that amphibia evolved from fish: at the very least, fins have to turn into legs, and gills into lungs. There was a well defined sequence of 7 key fossils showing this progressions. In this sequence, <i>Panderichthys</i> at 397 Ma &mdash; although breathing through a spiracle, and missing some fins &mdash; was clearly fishlike, while newt-like <i>Acanthostega</i> at 360 Ma had legs and feet (and 8 digits instead of 5) but was still aquatic. There was an urge to find an intermediate. The place to look was in shallow-water sediments deposited between these dates.

</span></a> author of a highschool text used in Muslim schools there and in the West, writes, &lsquo;Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long there is Islam&rsquo; &mdash; yet Islam still thinks itself a suitable world system.
</p>

<p>Cairo&apos;s Al-Azhar University describes itself as the world&apos;s oldest, but it didn&apos;t hold its first seminar until <a class="fn">975 CE.<span>
	The claim is anachronistic and vainglorious. Al-Azhar was a mosque, the &lsquo;university&rsquo; was devoted to Quranic studies, and the concept was taken from Jewish Talmudic colleges of Hillel and Shammai a millenium earlier. From the 6th-century BCE Babylonian Exile, until the 9th century CE, and sometimes later, Jewish colleges at Nahardea, Pumbedita, and Sura had thousands of students, and science was taught separately from religion.
</span></a> Its brochure explains that it &lsquo;pays special attention to the Quranic sciences and traditions of the prophet&rsquo;, and brags that &lsquo;newly introduced faculties are not duplicates of their counter-parts in other universities since they combine both the empirical as well as the religious sciences&rsquo;. In 50 years, I have never come across a research paper from Al-Azhar. When I list universities, I <a class="fn">get to 150<span>
	Perhaps I cheated by including Ankh-Morpork&apos;s Unseen University. But no: California has 5 campuses in the top 20; tiny Israel has 2 in the top 150 and 2 more in the top 400; the city of Hong Kong has 3 in the top 300; the whole Islamic world has 4 in the top 500, none of them Al-Azhar.
</span></a> without thinking of Al-Azhar. However, careful investigation shows that it has produced at least 2 progressive ideas. In 1925, Ali Abd al-Raziq argued for the separation of religion and politics in <cite>Islam and the Principles of Government</cite> &mdash; so the University fired him. More recently, a debate in Quranic &lsquo;science&rsquo; concerning erections in Paradise found Suyuti&apos;s traditional &lsquo;eternal&rsquo; impractical, and suggested that &lsquo;prolonged&rsquo; would be <a class="fn">more convenient.<span>
	Entirely independently, we thrashed a more general version of this out at Berkeley in 1941 (concluding that the desideratum, seemingly philosophical, is in practice a conditional aspect of transitory physiological perspective). We were 11-year old Cub Scouts, and the question seemed Important.
</span></a> &lsquo;Prolonged&rsquo; enrages traditional Moslems.

<p>When Abdel Rahman was convicted for the first (failed) attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, the Western press identified him as &lsquo;the blind sheik&rsquo;. What they should have told us is that he was the senior professor of Quranic studies at Al-Azhar, and what passes for a leading Islamic intellectual.
</p>

<p>Dr. Izzat Atiyya, head of the Hadith Department in the Faculty of Theology at Al-Azhar, found a truly Islamic way around a modern problem. An unrelated man and woman might find themselves in the prohibited situation of working together in a closed room. His solution, based on Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyya, and others, was to convert the pair into family members &mdash; showing, in a bizarre way, the importance of synthetic kinship to religion. This could easily be done if the woman were lactating, in which case she could simply breastfeed the man. Even the government&apos;s religious weekly <cite>Aqidati</cite> (2007-05-22) felt that this reflected &lsquo;a petrified point of view&rsquo;. Dr Attiya nicely illustrates <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#13">Weber&apos;s point</a> that any conclusion can be rationalized by the right choice of axioms.
</p>

<p>There are also fundamentalist Christian institutions in the US South which rank right along with the Islamic examples above. The saving difference is that Al-Azhar claims to be the best Islam has to offer, while the US South also has some world-class universities for those who need them.

<p>The ostensible purpose of the Intelligent Design movement cannot logically be its real purpose. It claims to aid our perennial attempt to understand the Universe, on the grounds that traditionally, whenever we described something that we did not understand, we attributed it to a god, and this worked in the Neolithic, so let&apos;s keep doing it.
</p>

<p>Planetary motion is the prototype: planets <i>were</i> gods for most of our conscious history, and they linger on as the often discredited &lsquo;influences&rsquo; of astrology. Today planetary motion is understood as conservation of angular momentum, resulting ultimately from turbulence in the early days. planets are neither gods themselves, nor are gods required to explain their motion. The Aegean philosophers of the Axial Age knew this 2 millennia ago, and built <a class="fn">little analog computers<span>
	F Charette (2006) &lsquo;High Tech from Ancient Greece&rsquo; <cite>Nature</cite> <b>444</b>: 551&ndash;552; see also 534&ndash;538; 587&ndash;591.
</span></a> to demonstrate the mathematical laws that governed the motions.
</p>

<p>Today, the obvious mysteries are still &lsquo;biological and cosmological origins&rsquo;. Naturally occurring molecular mechanisms have been analyzed that look remarkably like some of the suggestions in <a class="fn">Eric Drexler&apos;s<span>
	KE Drexler (1992) <cite>Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation</cite> (Wiley, NYC).
</span></a> <cite>Nanosystems</cite>. However, to attribute these to inherent &lsquo;complex specified information&rsquo; &mdash; the current euphemism, which replaces the &lsquo;Intelligent Designer&rsquo; by the information he specified &mdash; serves only to make a hard problem harder.
</p>

<p>As the endpaper about the <a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#EP2">Student Goddesses and Coyotl</a> indicates, I also find it convenient to postulate gods on whom we can blame our problems. But I &mdash; and I hope the reader &mdash; understand this as poetic license. The logical consequences of an Intelligent Designer are perhaps not obvious to those who look upon the Designer as a magical explanation. However, in reality, a Designer cannot be an <i>explanans</i>, but is instead an exceedingly difficult <i>explanandum</i>.
</p>

<p>If we continue to argue by analogy with our own experience, we arrive at this syllogism:
</p>


<ul>
<li>The Universe (designed or not) is complicated;</li>

<li>Designers are necessarily more complicated than the things they design;</li>

<li>Ergo any Intelligent Designer is more complex than the Universe;</li> </ul>


<p class="flu">and we are in worse shape than when we started, because we immediately face three Hard Problems instead of one:

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF), and similar science-based agencies, spend taxpayer money on carefully selected projects which the scientific community thinks can be accomplished by the people requesting the money, with the apparatus and hypotheses currently available. It is an imperfect process, but it got us useful things like hydrogen bombs and an understanding of El Niños. A lot of the science is done by people who work 60 hours a week for peanuts because they want to know the answers. NSF does <i>not</i> spend taxpayer money on ID because of Hard Problem 1 up there: nobody has suggested a productive approach. ID money comes from conservative private sources who usually insist loudly that any expenditure should return a profit. How do they hope to profit by a return to medieval thinking?
</p>

<p>No ID paper I have seen addresses Hard Problem 2. <i>Fiat lux, et lux erat</i> (&lsquo;Let there be light, and there was light&rsquo;) seems to be the extent of interest. How is this useful?
</p>

<p>Science fiction writers (of the sort whose daytime job is quantum field theory) explore the self-created universe as a working alternative to Hard Problem 3. We now have a self-consistent conjecture about how this can happen, and it makes a good basis for a novel. Nuclear physicists with imagination and conscience worry about the possibility of this happening again at CERN or Brookhaven, with possibly devastating consequences to the status quo.
</p>

<p>Think long about the agendas of the institutions that promulgate ID. While ID itself is an undecidable possibility, the version promoted so assiduously is a superficial idea unsupportable by logic, philosophy, or data. Who gains what by attacking rationalism? Why is it worth spending money to denigrate intellectuals? Who profits from an ignorant populace? What has ID contributed to the question of how god had created life if the Genesis story is poetical rather than factual? What has it done to increase the chance of civilization surviving the next century? Is it, perhaps, no more than a way of extracting money from the befuddled congregation?
