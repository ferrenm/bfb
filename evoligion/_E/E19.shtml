<p class="epi">The chapter title pays homage to The Project for a New America Century, many of whose members held high office during the Bush administrations. The question is whether we can survive to mid-century after their efforts.<br>
<b>Their goal</b>: &lsquo;<a class="fn">To promote American global leadership.&rsquo;<span>
	<cite>Rebuilding America's Defenses</cite> (PNAC, 2000).
</span></a>
<br>
<b>Their accomplishment</b>: &lsquo;[S]oaring federal deficits, real unemployment above 15 percent, steeply falling tax revenues, massive state budget crises, continuing high rates of mortgage defaults and foreclosures, business and personal bankruptcies galore, cratering commercial real estate, dying retail, crumbling infrastructure, dwindling trade, runaway medical expense, soaring food stamp applications.&rsquo; &mdash; <a class="fn">

	(as of 2013-11-05).
</span></a><br> To these we might add: Destabilization of the Middle East, permanent (unwinnable) wars, failure to address climate change, and a culture of resurgent racism, failing schools, police murders, and war on women and the middle class.
</p>

<p class="epi">I have been to the darkest corners of government, and what they fear is light. &mdash; Edward Snowden, NSA analyst and whistleblower, patriot, Nobel Peace Prize nominee
</p>

<p>The epigraphs are not unrelated. Together, they depict a US that has lost its moral compass and would embarrass the Framers of the Constitution. The right wing recognizes this, cannot imagine a way forward, and yearns for a world that never was, perhaps an antebellum gentleman-farmer plutocracy where mores were antediluvian, women subservient, and colored folk knew their place, picked the cotton, and neither voted nor ran for office.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;American global leadership&rsquo; in the 20th century was moral rather than military. Our enemies, Germany and Japan, emerged &mdash; with our help &mdash; as successful democracies. The UN, initiated and established on our shores, may have all the virtues of a committee when it comes to action, but it runs ~100 unsung narrow ventures where notional enemies cooperate because it is in their own best interest. We seem to have won the Cold War by leaking technical (largely military) secrets at a rate that exhausted the lumbering collective imagination and industrial capacity of the Soviets.
</p>

<p>Moral leadership lies within the purview of religion. The origin of religion shows that its purpose is to help us live together in <i>this</i> life (rather than preparation for some hypothetical future, or flattering an insecure god). The world does not need missionaries, but examples. The Peace Corps is among the best we have offered, but the good work of its 10,000 idealists can be undone by a single feudofascist directive of the IMF or World Bank (themselves organizations invented to maintain US market hegemony).
</p>

<p>Churches have always had trouble separating ethics from overbelief. Historically, the power that pothodoxy gives them over their flocks has been used for organizational survival. Civilizational survival asks them instead to use that power in aid of creating a sustainable culture. How might the churches implement Daniel Dennett&apos;s suggestion that religions could once again find constructive roles? Out of 5 possible options for the future of religion, his only optimistic scenario has religions competing to help humanity,
</p>

<blockquote>with one religion priding itself on its environmental stewardship, providing clean water for the world&apos;s billions, while another becomes duly famous for its concerted defense of social justice and economic equality. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	Dennett (2006)<span><cite>Breaking the Spell: Religion as a natural phenomenon</cite> (Penguin, London): 36.
<br>-------------------------------<br>
	The other possibilities: Religion becomes increasingly important until eventually one dominates (the Islamic project); Religion fades away (the French hope); Religion becomes a private vice, like smoking; Judgement Day/Rapture (re)occurs (the fundamentalist&apos;s perennial hope).
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach, which emphasizes ethics over overbelief, also eliminates vexing theological differences, since Zoroaster&apos;s essentials are sufficient guidance to generate <i>whatever</i> rewards might lie in wait, independent of sectarian ritual and tribal belief. The Constitution&apos;s promotion of &lsquo;the general Welfare&rsquo; is indistinguishable from Zoroaster&apos;s essentials. Secular and religious efforts <i>can</i> find common ground at the civilizational level.
</p>

<p>The reader may have noticed that Dennett&apos;s suggestion includes both Gaian and Eirenic <a href="../_A/A00.shtml#10">requirements</a> for <i>qualifying</i> as a religion. This chapter looks at related problems where the ability of churches to &lsquo;think globally and act locally&rsquo; could make a critical difference. It might seem that we are moving far from our theme here, dragging in economics, education, journalism, politics, law, corporations. But in society, no less than in the natural world, &lsquo;everything is connected to everything else&rsquo;, and all of these categories need attention. <b>Neither theology nor overbelief is involved; the goal is to regain what civilization we once achieved, despite the regressive efforts of Instinct-1.</b>

<p class="epi">Once you start genuinely subjecting government officials &mdash; including security apparatchiks and military brass &mdash; to the full extent of the law, there would be no end to the unraveling: senators, contractors, representatives, bureaucrats, generals, lobbyists, judges, corporate chiefs, [the White House] &mdash; the whole edifice of Establishment power would be shaken to the core as its leading lights went down, one after the other. &hellip; It would be, in effect, a re-founding of the Republic. &mdash; <a class="fn">

<p>The tense and mood of verbs in this chapter have imperceptibly shifted during the writing, from <a class="fn">future subjunctive<span>
	Since English has no future subjunctive, it is mostly the mood of the chapter itself (or perhaps the author) that has
	shifted.
</span></a> to past indicative, as events caught up with possibilities and suspicions.
</p>

<p>As the table of contents indicates, the chapter began as a catch-all, chiding the US church-going community for its failure to recognize Enlightenment values as compatible, if not with their various dogmas, at least with their ultimate concerns. Gradually and unintentionally, the things that need fixing disclosed an ongoing, if preposterous, project, to wit: Corrupting the world&apos;s most powerful nation, with a democratic tradition and Constitution &mdash; for 200 years an inspiration to the world and reproach to its many totalitarian governments &mdash; in favor of the medieval ascendency of louts and psychopaths that we know as the feudal system.
</p>

<p>Then came the obstructionist Tea Party with an approach that did not seem to fit with such Machiavellian manipulations. Table 19.1 is an attempt to distinguish two programs having the common goal of destroying the work of the Founding Fathers in the interest of egoism and greed, with different motives, both banal.

<p class="epi">In the early days, Ben Franklin, as representative of the Colonies, was asked by the British, how it was the Colonies collected enough taxes to care for the poor. Franklin&apos;s replied:  &lsquo;We have no poor houses in the Colonies, and if we had, we would have no one to put in them, as in the Colonies there is not a single unemployed man, no poor and no vagabonds.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>The world that I anticipated in my childhood and teens was that of Franklin's Colonies re-envisioned by utopian technocrats: it seemed obvious that increasingly intelligent machines would gradually reduce our working hours until 4-4-8-3-4 was a reality: a 4-hour work day, 4-day work week, 8-month work year, with 3-day weekends and a 4-month <a class="fn">vacation<span>
	That formula popped up effortlessly. A web search for its origin suggests that (in omnivorous teenage reading of Golden Age science fiction) I noticed it in
	Arthur Bell&apos;s <cite>Mankind United</cite> [click to read at Sacred Texts]. Less critical at 15 than at 85, I was evidently not put off by its perfervid style and turgid typography, and slipped the formula in next to <cite>Utopia</cite>, <cite>Erewhon</cite>, <cite>Looking Backward</cite>, <cite>News From Nowhere</cite>, <cite>Equality</cite>, <cite>R.U.R.</cite>, <cite>We</cite>, <cite>1984</cite>, <cite>Animal Farm</cite>, <cite>Brave New World</cite>, <cite>A Modern Utopia</cite>, and all the eu- and dys-topian sci-fi stories.<br>
	There are other proposals, perhaps more practical, such as A. Richard Miller&apos;s 30-hour, 3-day work week, with less commuting per unit productivity, and a 2-shift system that automatically doubles employment.
</span></a><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/mu/mu02.htm">â¬ï¸</a>.  The formula got the work load right. It&apos;s just that as we &lsquo;recover&rsquo; from the mortgage-brokers&apos; 2008 larceny binge, the efficiency of those intelligent machines has been converted to part-time employment, &lsquo;mcdonald&rsquo; wages, and <a class="fn">zero-hour contracts,<span>
	A British term for a contract which guaranteed no hours of employment, but wanted you on site in case a customer turned up. Eventually the law was changed so that you got paid for hours present, but it was a fight.
</span></a> with the resulting excess value appropriated by management.
</p>

<p>Given that the &lsquo;economy of abundance&rsquo; anticipated by <a class="fn">
	Stuart Chase&apos;s<span>(1934) <cite>Economy of Abundance</cite> (Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010)
</span></a> book of that title is apparently accessible, so that <i>ceteris paribus</i> we could make the American Dream of freedom from want and fear come true for all of us, why would feudalism appeal?
</p>

<p>A clue might be found in a recent <a class="fn">article<span>
	Amelia Gentleman (2013) &lsquo;Who wants to serve a billionaire?&rsquo; <cite>GW</cite> 2013-06-24.
</span></a> on training servants [curtsy and pull forelock] for the yachts of the super rich. It may not be the love of money that is at the root of the feudal urge, but ownership of people. Perhaps they <i>need</i> someone to feel superior to, else they have no self esteem.

<p class="epi">[Government:] an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself. &mdash; Ibn Khaldun (c1400), Berber father of sociology.

<p>The &lsquo;what&rsquo; of feudalism is easier to explain than the &lsquo;why&rsquo;. The retrogressive urge does not extend to unheated castles, tournaments, or feudal fealty. Material superabundance, trophy wives, obsequious service, omnipotent control, subservient womenfolk, and immunity from consequences, will do for getting on with. The idea that money might not suffice to purchase the government seems to be particularly galling.
</p>

<p>The effort to achieve this set of desiderata might be conscious, and the resulting activity a conspiracy, in the legal sense of a plan agreed to by a community. More likely, the motivation is the subliminal irritation of knowing that things are not as they should be, followed by setting them right when and as opportunity offers. <a href="../_F/F24.shtml#27">Emergent processes</a>, after all, are not guaranteed to be to our liking. What appears to be Machiavellian orchestration can also happen without planning, emerging from the logic of unrelated Instinct-1-driven events.
</p>

<p>A plausible start toward feudalism was made after the Civil War, lasting until 1929. The Great Depression looks like a miscalculation, but perhaps only because I have never seen a scorecard. Certainly some profited immensely. In any event it was set back by the New Deal and the post-war period up to ~1968. Reagan, amiable and Alzheimered, was the perfect front man for union-busting, plutocracy, and the start of the war on the Middle Class. Half a century later, the strategy &mdash; which changed dramatically in the 2010s &mdash; gives the impression that the major objectives had been achieved by the illegal acts described <a href="#35">below</a>, leaving the process to be completed by the clueless 3rd-string team of Tea Party demagogues shooting themselves in the foot.
</p>

<p>Still, the matter is one of complex and interrelated issues. Viewed in isolation, one sees only the stupidity of short-sighted greed. We may need corrective local action to reverse a misguided aberration, but nothing triggers a major alarm. Viewed in concert, it appears that that we have been sandbagged. The overall pattern looks as if <span class="br">&lsquo;they&rsquo; &mdash; the 1&permil; (that&apos;s per mil, or 0.1%)</span> &mdash; think they have already won, with sufficient infrastructure in place in the form of Big-Brother agencies, concentration camps, control of the Legislature and Supreme Court, data bases, drones, internet taps, jackboots, judges, laws, privatized jails, sock puppets, spies, and the media for disinformation and distraction.
</p>

<p>Make no mistake: We are fighting the same war that Franco&apos;s fascists won in Spain in 1936. The stock market&apos;s response to the election of Trump was nothing less than a victory celebration. The stock price of some <a href="https://bullshit.ist/10-stocks-that-had-double-digit-gains-on-trumps-win-that-are-terrifying-7421114b3233#.5fb8bwj1f">250 corporations</a> of dubious virtue rose by over 10% the day after the 2016 election: fossil-fuel companies, arms manufacturers, private prisons, for-profit colleges, pharmaceuticals, and banks. This response certainly explains the millions from out-of-state that defeated progressives like Zephyr Teachout.

<p>At the Spot Check, its Hey Presto! All the advantages of an enslaved population, and nobody notices except has-been rabble-rousers like Robert Reich and Bernie Sanders. It&apos;s taken less than 50 years (the election of Reagan, the <a class="fn">Powell<span>
	Two months later he was Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.
</span></a> Memorandum <a href="http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/Powell%20Archives/PowellMemorandumPrinted.pdf">â¬ï¸</a>, and the formation of ALEC and theÂ Heartland Institute marking the starting point). We accuse corporations of 90-day thinking, but that&apos;s just tactics. Against our 15-minute attention span, they are single-minded strategic elephants.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>feudal goals</i> have not changed, but today&aops;s methods, informed by Nobel-prize <a class="fn">economic theories<span>
	Note that the &lsquo;Nobel&rsquo; prize in economics is a late addition to the suite, administered by a bank, and therefore awarded for research that appeals to banksters. The &lsquo;derivatives&rsquo; that made possible the thievery of 2008 are an example.
</span></a> and psychological-manipulation experiments, are less messy and more effective.</li>

<li>The <i>rationale</i> appears to be recognition that aside from the privilege afforded by (usually inherited) wealth, the wannabe barons have no skills commensurate with their wants, and many of them would end up sleeping under bridges if they had to compete on even terms.</li>

<li>The <i>aspiration</i> of the 1&permil; is full-blown feudalism, in which the 1&permil; own, say, 999&permil; of the wealth, and the whole 999&permil; curtsy and tug their forelocks.</li>
</ul>


<p class="flu"> As noted <a href="../_D/D16.shtml#27">earlier</a>, and re-iterated in Table 19.2, this is a self-defeating goal, because even bicameral civilizations collapse before 2% of the population owns 98% of the wealth. The 21st century suggest that with a conscious, introspective population, serious instability sets in as soon 10% owns 50% of the wealth. The question becomes: is the militarization of the police, gerrymandering, and disenfranchising of voters, sufficient?
</p>

<p>The Republicans have no problem finding regressive (Instinct-1) candidates for every office. The Democratic response has been to copy them a smidgen to the left, with the result that in 2016 Clinton should have been running on a Republican ticket and Trump on a Fascist (with a little ingenuity, we might have had Bernie as a Democrat and Clinton as a Republican). The obvious need is a Democratic Party that can field progressives (Instinct-2) in every contest.

<p>In the absence of deliberate obfuscation, &lsquo;money&rsquo; is not complicated. It is an arbitrary token that measures market exchangeability. All that is required is that it be difficult to counterfeit, convenient, and socially accepted. If in addition its <i>supply</i> is regulated in the common interest, we have an ideal currency.
</p>

<p>The question is, what did Rothschild see that might have inspired the epigraph? People had been minting coins for 2500 years without getting excited about the job. What was new in 1810 was the international trade of the Enlightenment, and the imperial aspirations of Napoleon, but Rothschild&apos;s insight was nascent in the activity of medieval goldsmiths.

<p class="epi">You can place more faith in me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men; in a serpent, whose sting makes your blood cold the very next moment; or in a rat, which does a thousand mischiefs in your house. But never trust a goldsmith. &mdash; Indian folk wisdom, from the days when goldsmiths filled the role that bankers fill today.
</p>

<p>The local goldsmith, having an obvious supply of valuables, was often asked for loans, which frequently became a major source of income. In the manner of loan sharks everywhere, he made the rules, and made them profitable. In addition, being a natural target for thieves, he had a strongbox to protect his stock, and did a bit of business protecting his neighbor&apos;s valuables also, giving them receipts describing the deposited wealth (often gold coins). His customers then found it convenient to exchange the receipts instead of the objects they represented, just as we find paper money convenient today.
</p>

<p>Once such receipts were accepted by the community as being &lsquo;as good as gold&rsquo; the goldsmith found that he could issue receipts against his own wealth in exchange for market goods. The receipts might circulate for indefinitely before he was asked to redeem them. He was, in effect, making interest-free loans to himself. (If caught short, he might always claim that a particular receipt was counterfeit.) Then, finding that deposited valuables were never all reclaimed at the same time, he could with little risk, do his own counterfeiting by creating more receipts for uniform items like gold coins, than he had coins in his strongboxes.
</p>

<p>This is exactly how banks create money today, although such  <b>counterfeiting by an entity legally empowered to create circulating currency</b> is evil (it benefits the counterfeiter and dilutes the value of existing currency). It is also central to <a class="fn"><cite>Modern Money Mechanics</cite>.<span>
	Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (1992?) subtitled <cite>A Workbook on Bank Reserves and Deposit Expansion</cite>. 50 pp.
</span></a> It deserves a name of its own, and the logical choice is <i>autofeiting</i>. One caution: it gets messy when done by every neighborhood bank, so we thought a central bank would be an improvement.

<p>The more depositors a goldsmith had, the less the risk of a &lsquo;bank run&rsquo;, when too many customers wanted receipts redeemed simultaneously, so there was always pressure for more depositors. This could be done by reducing storage fees, or giving depositors a bit of the interest (without necessarily explaining in detail that he was risking their money). This is still relatively honest, and is called &lsquo;deposit banking&rsquo;. NaÃ¯ve depositors are likely to think that this is <a class="fn">how the system works,<span>
	Despite having read books like Coogan&apos;s <cite>Money Creators</cite> in my teens, the banking practice therein described seemed so &mdash; well, <i>unethical</i> &mdash; that I never really believed that it happened in America. Nobody I knew would do that! This na&iuml;vet&eacute; was strongly reinforced by a vignette in <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite> or <cite>Reader&apos;s Digest</cite> (or both) about a Midwest (?) banker who had gone bankrupt and then spent the rest of his life paying back his depositors.<br>
	Disillusionment set in (decades later) when I learned that the vignette was fiction (commissioned by the American Bankers Association), and was completed by the involvement of the 1&permil; in the events of 9/11 and 2008.

<li>the Banco del Piazza del Rialto (Venice, 1584&ndash;1619),</li>

<li>the Bank of Amsterdam (1609&ndash;c1700),</li>

<li>the Bank of Hamburg (c1600&ndash;1816).</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">Except for one small problem, it worked well. Nevertheless, says <a class="fn">Griffin,<span>

<p class="epi">Banking is inherently unstable in that it involves both lending out most of what is borrowed from depositors (and keeping only a fraction on reserve, for example, 10%). &mdash;<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1784365" class="fn">Jennifer Taub<span>
	J Taub (2011) &lsquo;What We Donât Talk About When We Talk About Banking&rsquo; (February 10, 2011) in G Epstein, MH Wolfson (eds.) <cite>Oxford Handbook of the Political Economy of Financial Crises</cite> (Oxford University Press, 2013). [The quote is only in the first draft of 2011.]
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Taub&apos;s description sounds simple and reasonable. The instability arises because the deposits are inherently short term and the loans long term, and this can lead to banking runs if depositors get nervous. But this is not the real problem. Consider a $100 deposit in 1910, in the form of 10 gold &lsquo;St Gaudens&rsquo; $10 <a class="fn">eagles.<span>
	These market price of the gold in these eagles was almost their value as legal ender. The US Mint charges a bit of <i>seigniorage</i>: &lsquo;Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin&rsquo;, says Wikipedia.
</span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage">â¬ï¸</a> The bank reserves one gold piece and loans 9. Doing this 10 times results in $100 on reserve and $900 in loans. This is an honest, if somewhat risky, business: 2 depositors might come in on the same day and ask to withdraw their money. The banker must talk them into settling for half their money today, but he explains that the bank&apos;s &lsquo;real&rsquo; assets are the $900 (plus interest) he is expecting to be repaid by borrowers, so there is no problem if they will just be patient. If they insist, and sue, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (ie, the taxpayer) guarantees repayment. This is what is meant by the statement that all of the money in circulation is backed by debt.
</p>

<p>Now consider what really happens. Todayâs deposit is in the form of 10 $10 Federal Reserve Notes, marked &lsquo;legal tender&rsquo;, meaning the government has to accept them as money if you use them to pay tax. The banker puts the whole $100 on reserve and loans $900 by making ink (or electronic) entries in a ledger. This notation joins the pool of notational money that constitutes the accounting system of commerce.
</p>

<p>An example: I once withdrew Â£30,000 in cash from my Irish bank, which the bank gave me in a small canvas bag marked &lsquo;Â£200 in pennies&rsquo;. I transferred the bills to my pants pockets (and added a second layer of pants just to baffle pickpockets) smuggled it to Europe and loaned it to a friend, who passed it &lsquo;under the table&rsquo; to the seller of a house, who obligingly knocked Â£50,000 off the selling price of the house and forgot to report the cash as income. The Irish bank personnel were as complicit in this illegal transaction as I was, and everybody was happy except the European government, who never noticed. The bottom subsequently dropped out of the housing market (think US 2008), and I will probably never get repaid, but in Ben Franklin&apos;s approach, my loan will ultimately be repaid to someone else who can put it to good use.
</p>

<p>The point of that story is that this is the largest amount of cash I have ever seen at one time. All other transactions involved notational money, including that in my pension account and the value of my house. I have never embarrassed a banker by wanting to withdraw more money than he had in his 10% reserve. In this respect, the system works.

<p class="epi">In Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated; my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks. &mdash; Spencer Bachus, Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
</p>

<p>The problem with Bachus&apos;s view is an implicit &lsquo;serve the banks <b>at the expense of the people</b>&rsquo;. People attracted to banking never seem to be devoted to the common welfare. In the manner of <a class="fn">L. Ron Hubbard<span>
	Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter, 1972-03-19, MS OEC 384.
</span></a> and Scientology, their highest aspiration seems to be &lsquo;MAKE MONEY. MAKE MORE MONEY. MAKE OTHER PEOPLE PRODUCE SO AS TO MAKE MORE MONEY.&rsquo; Banking as it has developed combines the 2 easiest ways of making money: autofeiting, and theft &mdash; both of them parasitic.
</p>

<p>Deposit banking served the public well and made bankers prosperous. Its small problem was that it didn&apos;t make them <i>sufficiently</i> prosperous. Legalizing two common practices was needed to fix this:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Loaning Other People&apos;s Money</b>. This was not legal until 1848, when a British court obligingly ruled that a banker could do what he willed with money on deposit &mdash; a ruling described as &lsquo;lucid, incorrect, and disastrous&rsquo;, for it converted a troubled banker from &lsquo;an embezzler and a thief&rsquo;, into a merely insolvent businessman.</li>

<li><b>Loan more money than you have on deposit</b>. By the fractional-reserve rules now in play one can generally loan 10 times this amount. This allows our technically bankrupt embezzler and thief to autofeit money more or less ad lib. Private banks like the &lsquo;Federal&rsquo; Reserve System then proceeded to do exactly this, issuing their own bank notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>And this was all that was needed to allow the 1&permil; to appropriate half the world&apos;s wealth (so far). Because Instinct-1 lacks the concept of <i>enough</i>, I suspect that no one among the 1&permil; sees anything unethical in Washington serving the banks. Such people despise altruism as fiscally inefficient and so lack its annoying internalization that we call &lsquo;conscience&rsquo;.


<p>It usurps the Constitutional monopoly on money creation and supervision of the economy and places these in private hands. Furthermore, when the loan is paid back, it is paid back in real money. The bank has converted ink or electronic ledger entries into legal tender.
</p>

<p class="epi">If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, ï¬rst by inï¬ation and then by deï¬ation, the banks and the corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered. &mdash; A retroquote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, apparently in a 1937 Congressional subcommittee report (Snopes).
</p>

<p>The history of paper money shows many such private notes issued by local banks. These are the exact equivalent of the receipts of the local goldsmith, and offered the same opportunity of profit by autofeiting as the goldsmith&apos;s fake receipts. They led to occasional bank failures, creating an argument for a central bank large enough to avoid bank runs (and centralize the profit.)
</p>

<p>Reserving the power to create money to a central bank was balanced by guaranteeing individual banks protection from bank runs. Rothschild probably did not publicize his reasons for volunteering for the onerous task of central banking, but however he managed it, he and his sons became the central bankers of Europe, making autofeiting a family monopoly. It is not difficult to persuade a legislature (or sovereign) of the desirability of a central bank, because borrowing money from it provides them with a revenue source that does not require taxpayer approval. This is an offer that few politicians can resist.
</p>

<p>200 years later, nearly to the day &mdash; and a century after the establishment of the current central bank &mdash; not-Jefferson&apos;s epigraphic prediction of homelessness came true for many Americans. Jobs gone overseas and real wages lower than 40 years ago led to foreclosure of many &lsquo;sub-prime&rsquo; loans. The terms of these loans were too good to be true. Prima facie (guilty until proved innocent) analysis suggests that this was done with the express intent of later repossession, which is a win-win situation for the banksters, because the law allows them to disregard accumulated equity. (This is not true in civilized countries, where repossession at least requires that the bank return the equity, if not the interest.) The banksters kept all the equity of the homeless, and corporations that had grown up around them then rented the houses back to the less impoverished among the homeless, adding another nuance to the adjective &lsquo;bankerly&rsquo;.
</p>


As of 2017-03-03,

<blockquote>Altogether, accounting for both the TARP and the Fannie and Freddie bailout, G$623 has gone out the door &mdash; invested, loaned, or paid out &mdash; while G$390 has been returned. &mdash; <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/">Pro Publica</a>
</blockquote>



</p>

<p>Descriptions of <i>actual</i> banking practice seem like crackpot conspiracy theories to rational people. Nevertheless, money creation and its concomitant, inflation, are mysterious only as long as one believes that the money supply is managed by benevolent professionals for the good of the country. Like most things managed, it is managed for the benefit of the managers.
</p>

<p>Note that the Founding Fathers left the details of money management to Congress, with no guidance about details. Taking control away from the banksters was a giant step forward, and sufficient for the day.

<p>Consider a toy model
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14">
	<img class="im" src="../Images/K-Arithmetic3.gif" alt="Arithmetic"/></a>
of a state which like the US, needs a T$1 (one teradollar, $1e12, or a trillion-dollar) investment in its decaying public infrastructure &mdash; transport (roads, bridges, rail, canals), communications (fiber optics), power distribution (electrical grid), etc. We ignore the cost of materials, and any need for specialist labor. The state has 100 million (1e8) workers. For simplicity, we pay minimum-wage, maximum-hours: at $10/hr and a 10-hour day, this comes to $100 per worker day, while a population-day costs 1e8 x $100 or $1e10 or G$10, ten billion dollars or 10 gigadollars. A teradollar is G$1000, so to rebuild the infrastructure, we need <b>100 population-days of labor</b>. There are several options.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>CorvÃ©e</b>. In the feudal, pre-capitalist system, labor was	owed to the local lord, commonly 1 or 2 days a month. Working 100% of the population 1 day a month would require 100 months (roughly 8 years), and no money would change hands.</li>

<li><b>Business-As-Usual</b>. A construction crew could occupy 5% of the population 20 days a month, which also requires about 8 years. Here the government borrows 1T$ from the banks to pay the construction crew, adds it to the national debt, and then pays interest on it at 3%, for a tax bill of 0.03 x $1e12 / 1e8-workers = $300/worker annually. Since the national debt is never paid off (in the banksters&apos; ideal world) we pay forever &mdash; just as we do for for toll roads that were going to be free as soon as they were paid for).</li>

<li><b>Bond Issue</b>. If the government borrows $1e12 from  1e8 people, it gets $1e4 per worker. This becomes a reasonable savings account, paid in over the 8 year course of the constructions, at $1200/yr. Interest on the loan is 0.03 x $1e12 or G$30, or $3e10 / 1e8 per creditor, which is $300 yearly interest, just balancing his added tax. This doesn&apos;t reduce the principal, but the trillion-dollar improvement is in place. Rail tickets, road and bridge tolls,  internet charges &mdash; things we normally pay in any case &mdash; are paid to the government and gradually reduce the principal, which is returned to workers when they cash in their bonds. The infrastructure repair cost essentially nothing.</li>

<li><b>Central Bank</b>. If the government borrows from the bankers of the Federal Reserve, no actual money is involved, just autofeiting, in the form of electronic credits, exchanged for T-bills (US Treasury promises-to-repay). The private bankers of the Fed are the ones who collect the G$30 interest. Divided among, say, 300 families of the 1&permil;, thats a 100 million a year to each in tax-free unearned income. The annual tax increase to repay this loan is $300/worker, which may not seem like much, but year after year it has transferred half the nation&apos;s wealth to the 1&permil;.</li>
</ol>

	Silas Walter Adams (1958) <span><cite>The Legalized Crime of Banking</cite> (Meador, Boston): Ch 19.
</span></a></p>

<p>A highly recommended, entertaining, and informative long version of money creation &mdash; 600 pages &mdash; is <a class="fn">

</span></a> <cite>The Creature from Jekyll Island</cite>, now in the 25th printing of its 4th edition. The short version is that <b>Central-Bank currency is autofeit</b>. The process was imported to the US in 1781 by Robert Morris, a wealthy Philadelphia businessman and delegate to the Continental Congress. Copying Rothschild&apos;s Bank of England, he got the notes of his Bank of North America designated as the monopoly legal tender (ie, you had to use them to pay tax). Then,
</p>

<blockquote>[w]hen he failed to raise the legally required specie capital to launch the Bank of North America, Robert Morris, in an act tantamount to embezzlement, simply appropriated specie loaned to the US by France and invested it on behalf of the government in his own bank. &hellip; A <i>multiple</i> of these funds was then borrowed back from Morris&apos;s bank by Morris as government financier for the pecuniary benefit of Morris as banker; and finally, Morris channeled most of the money into <a class="fn">war contracts<span>
	Vice President Dick Cheney was a piker by comparison, managing only the last step in this sequence, channelling government war spending into no-bid/no-audit contracts to Haliburton, the company he once ran. Still, we must credit people like Morris and Cheney with resolving the old dilemma of &lsquo;a choice between private plunder and public graft&rsquo; by combining them. Despite all this, Morris was celebrated by a portrait on the $1000 greenback of 1863 (but apparently only 4 were ever printed).

</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the &lsquo;multiple&rsquo; in Morris&apos;s lending: with bank notes and letters of credit, he may have loaned 10 times the specie on deposit (today&apos;s usual limit) or more. This was the initial example of &lsquo;our fraudulent system of fractional reserve banking and &hellip; the disastrous inflations of the past two centuries&rsquo;, but it was sorely needed money and no one was going to look too closely into its origins.
</p>

<p>The unasked question is &lsquo;Where did the [extra] money come from?&rsquo; &mdash; and the answer is &lsquo;the most important single thing to know about modern banking &mdash; <i>it came out of thin air</i>.&rsquo; {98, emphasis added}. Consequently, all banks are technically bankrupt under fractional reserve rules, which is why loss of trust and disastrous &lsquo;bank runs&rsquo; occur. The <cite>Guardian&apos;s</cite> finance writer <a class="fn">
	Joris Luyendijk<span>&lsquo;Where are the financial whistleblowers?&rsquo; <cite>The Guardian</cite> 2011-12-27.
</span></a> points out that in London, workers in the financial sector whose skills would earn them Â£20,000 in the real world are paid Â£80,000. This goes far to suppress their curiosity about how this is managed, and creates a certain reluctance about whistleblowing. Where <i>does</i> this money come from? My authorities are divided on this question.
</p>

<p>If a legitimate business overpaid its clerks by a factor of 4, and gave its management million-dollar bonuses out of its profit, its competitors would take market share by charging less. Yet these practices continue in the face of public opprobrium and notional governmental supervision. <i>The clients do not complain</i>, so it is difficult to see how the bonuses could come from overcharging.
</p>

<p>If one asks on an economics blog, where nominally well informed people discuss such questions, what happens to the loan repayment, they tell you, &lsquo;It goes back into the banking system&rsquo;. Back? 90% of it was never <i>in</i> the banking system, and was created by making an entry in an account. The Federal Reserve System&apos;s <cite>Modern Money Mechanics</cite> belabors other details, but glides past this one. Rothbard offers a passing explanation {of his Fig. 9.7}: &lsquo;The Central Bank notes themselves were simply retired and burned.&rsquo; Griffin says &lsquo;it is the act of paying off the debt that causes [the recently created money] to vanish&rsquo; {184}, and adds that the amount not classified as interest is &lsquo;extinguished&rsquo; {192}. This is undeniably what <i>should</i> happen &mdash; but some of this money is in the form of electronic transfers and some of it in the used, unmarked $10 and $20 bills beloved by kidnappers. <a class="fn">
	Silas Adams<span>SW Adams (1958) <cite>The Legalized Crime of Banking</cite> (Meador, Boston): Ch. 8.
</span></a> says bluntly, &lsquo;Every dollar a banker creates ultimately buys for him a big dollar&apos;s worth of something!&rsquo; &mdash; &lsquo;big&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;the return of the loan plus interest, less the cost of doing business&rsquo; &mdash; and adds that the banker simply keeps 2 sets of books.
</p>

<p>I will grant that the Fed&apos;s, Rothbard&apos;s, and Griffin&apos;s books are better written than Adams&apos;s, and a little more sober in tone &mdash; but they agree in covering this one crucial detail in a single comforting sentence, while providing convincing detail and references for every other aspect of banking. Adams-, quotes the President of the Bank of England:
</p>

<blockquote>Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin.&hellip; Bankers own the world. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money and control credit, and with a flick of the pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again.&hellip; Take this power away from bankers, and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, because this would then be a better and a happier world to live in.&hellip; But if you want to continue to be the slaves of bankers, and pay the costs of your own slavery, let them continue to create money, and control credit. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	Sir Josiah Stamp<span>Talk at the University of Texas, ~1920.
</span></a>
</blockquote>


<p>In any case, <b>no one audits the Fed.</b> There seems to be no formal mechanism for ensuring that returned principal is in fact &lsquo;extinguished&rsquo;. Have you ever known anyone to burn money when he could pocket it with no one noticing? Why would a banker devious enough to design this system (and who needs to pay excessive salaries, ridiculous bonuses, expensive lobbyists, and and array of politicians) do something that silly?
</p>

<p>I suspect that the system works as in Fig. 19.1.</p>

Money creation <a class="fn">since 1848<span>
	The process is more complex than the cartoon. Fractional-reserves are not needed for such small deposits, the Fed may get involved in larger ones, US government bond purchases by banks determines the amount of money they can create, and we have skimmed over the conversion of the ink (or electrons) that constitutes the original loan into legal bank notes.
	<br>The  multiplication occurs when the loan is redeposited, the redeposit added to the reserve, and most of it loaned again. For a $1000 loan and 10% reserve, the sequence of loans based on the growing reserve is 1000 + 900 + 810 + 729 + 656 + 590 + 531 + 478 + 430 + 387 + 348 + 314 + 282 + 254 + 228 + 206 + 185 + 167 + 150 + 135 + 122 + 109 + 98 + 89 + 80 + &hellip;. This is the infinite harmonic series <i>c</i>Î£<sub>i</sub><i>x<sup>i</sup></i> = <i>c</i>/(1-<i>x</i>) with <i>x</i> = 0.9 and <i>c</i>=1000, which sums to $10,000.
	<br>The value of the loan comes not from anything done by the bank, but from the dilution of the existing money supply, exactly as though you yourself had counterfeited the money you &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo;.
</span></a>. The trick lies in the bank&apos;s permission to lend many times its cash reserve, creating the additional money <a class="fn"><i>ex nihilo</i><span>
	Early drafts of this caption added the sentence: &lsquo;At least one [New England?] court refused to honor a bank&apos;s suit for repayment of a loan on the grounds that nothing real was loaned, and thus no contract existed.&rsquo; However, I cannot now relocate that statement on the web. If it be true, appellate courts exist to eliminate such inconvenient honesty.
</span></a>.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>Two things happen under Fractional Reserve Rules. One is the multiplication of interest on your $1000. Suppose that the infinite series is in practice terminated early, so that bank(s) only earn interest on 10 times the first loan: 10Ã6% = 60% (of which you get $30 and the bank $570). The 19:1 split of the interest says everything there is to say about the adjective &lsquo;bankerly&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>The other is that borrowers pay back the $10,000 loans. They went out as notations in ledgers, paper or silicon. They circulate and return as checks and currency. (This works because the pool of currency is large and constantly changing as it wears out and is replaced. Only in the ledgers is anything tracked.) It is trivial to zero out the ledgers, if desired, but what does one do about the currency itself? One could add the amount to the worn-out paper to be withdrawn. Or one could pocket it and balance the ledgers by sliding the returned loan into another set of books. Who'd notice?
</p>

<p>If one prints money and spends it (in the manner of counterfeiters), people may notice. However, if the creation is autofeit and is incidental to making a loan, any banker can pocket it when it is paid back. It was the genius of Mayer A. Rothschild to see that a central bank (disguised as an arm of government) would not only obfuscate the process of money creation, but return the new money to the pockets of the central bank. As he may or may not have explained, ca. 1800, &lsquo;<b>Let <a class="fn">me issue and control<span>
	By the next generation &mdash; with Amschel Jr. in Berlin, Jacob in Paris, Kalmann in Naples, Nathan in London, and Salomon in Vienna &mdash; it wasn&apos;t just &lsquo;a nation&rsquo;, but <i>Europe</i> whose money the Rothschilds controlled. In 1815, Nathan, the model for the urbane and powerful Sidonia in Disraeli&apos;s <cite>Coningsby</cite>, multiplied his fortune 20-fold using a 24-hour advance notice of Wellington&apos;s victory at Waterloo, brought by a Rothschild courier (either a rider or a pigeon, depending on which story you believe). Earlier, Jacob had organized the smuggling of Rothschild gold to Wellington (in the Pyrenees). His biographer writes, &lsquo;In the space of a few hundred hours Meyer&apos;s youngest had not only gotten the English gold rolling through France, but conjured a fiscal mirage that took in Napoleon himself. A teen-age Rothschild tricked the imperial government into sanctioning the very process that ruined it&rsquo;, by telling them that the British were desperate to keep English gold out of France.

As it is, it shows a real, if relatively small, increase in the national wealth, tracking some function of population and productivity. <i>V</i> is the driving force for the major variation; its linear rise after 1993 looks almost deliberate, but both the approximations, and the departures from them, need analysis by an expert.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>If the loan repayment were burned, the money supply <i>V</i> would not increase as it has in Fig. 19.2. Where else would bankers find the G$33 they pay themselves in annual bonuses &mdash; and Congress the trillions to pay for &lsquo;quick and decisive police actions&rsquo; like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan? This is as close to &lsquo;victimless&rsquo; theft as one can get, because the money is not stolen from any identifiable person. Its value is obtained by diluting the value of all money in society. Invisible theft is still theft; the bonus payments and Haliburton&apos;s no-bid contracts and Cheney&apos;s millions are wealth stolen by the invisible tax of inflation.
</p>

<p>Morris&apos;s Bank of North America was our first central bank, chartered under the Continental Congress. The Federal Reserve System is our 4th central bank (the first 3 having led to inflation and bank panics so blatant that their charters were not renewed). The 2 reasons for this perennial return to a flawed system are:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li>People object less to losing money to regressive inflation (which hits the poor harder than the rich) than they do to paying the same money in progressive taxes (which properly increase percentage-wise with income). Inflation, in the public mind, is a mysterious process which cannot be blamed on anyone; taxes are the work of expendable Congressmen. Obviously politicians are going to prefer inflation on both counts.</li>

<li>The same process that creates money for bonuses creates money for bribes and campaign contributions. Some of our best and most moral political figures have succumbed to this process &mdash; Daniel Webster <a class="fn">among them<span>
	GE Griffin (1994) <cite>The Creature from Jekyll Island: a Second Look at the Federal Reserve</cite> 4th ed. (American Media, California, 2009): 351.
</span></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Founding Fathers wrote a Constitution which tried its best to avoid this. They intentionally gave Congress the money-creation power coveted by bankers. What legal backing there is for the Federal Reserve System comes from Supreme Court case law that conveniently find its operations necessary for Congress to carry out other prescribed duties. This is not true: Andrew Jackson had deliberately killed our 3rd central bank, paid off the national debt from the War of 1812, run up a surplus, and returned M$35 <a class="fn">to the states<span>
	GE Griffin (1994) <cite>The Creature from Jekyll Island: a Second Look at the Federal Reserve</cite> 4th ed. (American Media, CA, 2009): Ch. 17.
<br-----------------<br>
	As Griffin points out, nothing in politics is an unmixed blessing. In his fight against the central bank, Jackson also took the first steps toward today&apos;s imperial presidency, claiming to be the people&apos;s representative while nearly all Congressmen were indebted to the Bank. Still, an unbought President is better than a bought Congress.
</span></a> &mdash; showing that we are perfectly capable of carrying out the prescribed duties of government without a central bank and without going into debt. However, in the process, he left banking in the hands of a multitude of unregulated private banks, many of which failed, with their depositors' money vanishing. The problem is not just the Fed, but fractional-reserve banking.
</p>

<p>The details of the Fed (no longer a &lsquo;bank&rsquo;, but a &lsquo;System&rsquo;) were designed in defiance of the Constitution. Defects of the earlier ventures were corrected, and the goals of the new one outlined, at a week-long private meeting on J.P. Morgan&apos;s Jekyll Island in 1913, where 7 men, <a class="fn">representing 25%<span>

<p class="epi">Economists who pander to plutocrats have a great advantage over scholars in other fields: There is no reputational penalty among your peers for being dead wrong. &mdash; Wm. K. Black, Federal Bank Regulator. [By this he meant that theories winning Nobel Economics Prizes (awarded by the Norwegian Riksbank) do not need to be correct. Apparently the criterion is that they be profitable. To the banks.]
</p>

<p>Nasty bankerly behavior may be unethical, destructive, and uncivilized, but it is not illegal. For instance, if your house is mortgaged, and you run into economic troubles, banks can and have foreclosed
when a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/steve-mnuchins-bank-foreclosed-90-year-old-over-27-cents-trumps-cabinet-pick-2453345">.$0.27 error</a>. offered an opportunity. This has resulted in some 4 million foreclosures lately, mostly in Black neighborhoods and evicting some 10 million people, often at SWAT-team gunpoint. In the US, banks are not required to pay you the equity you have accumulated (the portion of the loan that you have <a class="fn">paid back,<span>
	The ideal loan is one in which payments just cover interest and fees, so that no equity accumulates and the loan is never reduced. People may notice this, so the next best approach is the &lsquo;balloon payment&rsquo;, which applies a minimum to reducing the loan, a maximum to fees and interest, and has the major portion of the loan come due at the end of the schedule.
<br>------------------<br>
	See R Barr (1906) <cite>The Triumphs of Eugene Valmont</cite> (Dover, NY, 1985): Ch. XVI, for a literary description of a similar approach.
</span></a> adjusted by current <a class="fn">house prices).<span>
	My Norwegian bank, having based its loan on a 2-million kroner evaluation of my 17th-century house, decided one day that it was worth only 1 million. Since I owed more than that for repairs underway, they wanted me to increase my collateral. This sudden adjustment was, they admitted, based on prices in Los Angeles and Tokyo &mdash; totally irrelevant to sleepy little Bergen! (My response was to cut my losses and leave &mdash; them the house and me the country.)
</span></a> Adding insult to injury, banks frequently manage to charge another $30,000 in &lsquo;transaction costs&rsquo;. After enough campaign contributions, this form of theft becomes the law of the land. Civilized countries (e.g., the UK) have more honest arrangements.
</p>

<p>Clearly, banks find the process profitable despite occasional token fines. Wells Fargo paid a M$42 fine for racial discrimination in evictions without batting an eye. Required by law to protect and maintain the value of repossessed homes, banks seldom bother. In 2011, Bank of America paid <a class="fn">M$335<span>

</span></a> for failing to do this. Countervailing profits arise because the banks now own large swaths of housing that can be rented to previous owners until the housing market recovers and they can be profitably sold. Current fines are small change and need an order of magnitude increase. Or more, until our laws ensure that uncivilized behavior cuts into management pay.

</p>

<p>Morgan&apos;s guests at Jekyll Island were banksters, epitomizing a class with what appears to be a particular agenda. Their proximate tactical goals were specific: profit; avoidance of publicity, audit, and oversight; a monopoly in capital creation; control of the US money supply; and &mdash; adding insult to injury &mdash; a procedure whereby taxpayers would rescue the system from the inescapable bank failures and panics of the future (we know it as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). The major difficulty would be to persuade Congress that the standard European approach to these problems had not been specifically written out of the Constitution (Article I.8.5) &mdash; but in the event, the only one who noticed was Minnesota Congressman Charles Lindbergh (father of the aviator).
</p>

<p>They achieved their goals, and 2 centuries later not-Jefferson&apos;s prediction of homelessness came true for <a class="fn">630,000 Americans,<span>
	Homelessness Research Institute (2013) <cite>The State of Homelessness in America 2013</cite> (National Alliance to End Homelessness, Washington DC).
</span></a> with neither the homeless, nor those who counted them, understanding why it had happened. I am not saying that the banksters foresaw the details of 2008, but that their criminogenic system made it inevitable, and guaranteed that (after taking the opportunity to sacrifice a few competing banks to public opinion) they could bamboozle us into comforting them with a full year&apos;s GDP. In effect, every person in the country worked all year for a handful of banksters. Historically, it appears that they can manage a full-scale heist like this about once a century.
</p>

<p>At 3 or 4 generations per century, this heist rate is unfair to the generations that miss out. We need to think big here &mdash; there was a time when everyone worked full time for the 1&permil;. How to return to this happy condition? The strategic goal seems most concisely described as a return to the cozy feudal oligarchy enjoyed by nobles after the Magna Carta limited the power of King John, absorbing all of the privileges of rank (<b>Privatize the Profit</b>), while laying off all of its responsibilities on others (<b>Socialize the Cost</b>). Ministers and the incipient Parliament take the blame, and serfs pay for it. If this seems absurd, W. J. Ghent, a century ago (when the parasite/worker pay ratio was a mere 14:1) described the US as already having &lsquo;a socio-economic status that contains all the essentials of a renascent Feudalism&rsquo;. Ghent&apos;s key insight is that a manager sees himself as the benevolent and
</p>

<blockquote>primary cause of things. He is at once the loaf-giver to the needy, the regulator of temporal affairs, the lord protector of church and society; and he holds his title directly from the Creator &mdash; <a class="fn">

</span></a>
</blockquote>


<p class="flu">and so can do no wrong. They tell us they provide the jobs, even while downsizing and globalizing. They would raise &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; to a moral right. Said one in response to a philosopher&apos;s request for candidates for moral foundations:

 <blockquote>I understand and accept the necessity of taxes, but only for the purposes of government&apos;s enumerated powers [often the only one mentioned is common defense]. Other than that my money is part of my freedom and it is &lsquo;not yours to give&rsquo;. The sense of ownership is so strong that I wonder if it might be part of the mind&apos;s initial draft, and therefore a tentative candidate for a sixth moral foundation. &mdash; <a class="fn">Steve Messenger<span>
	People like this should be sent &mdash; with all of their money and worldly goods &mdash; to spend a decade on a pleasant, life-supporting, but <i>deserted</i> Caribbean island, and no contact allowed with society. This might help them understand that it is society that made their accumulation possible, and that the government was constituted to &lsquo;provide for the general Welfare&rsquo;. </span></a>
</blockquote>


<p>They see legislative interference with their benevolence as by nature unconstitutional, and appoint judges to do the same. &lsquo;[T]he overwhelming majority of laws which fail to reach the constitutional standards set by our judges are those intended to &hellip; set some limitation to the powers of the industrially mighty&rsquo; {112}. Rockefeller saw the growth of monopoly as &lsquo;the working out of a law of nature and a law of God&rsquo;. Ghent&apos;s restrained language is &mdash; as suggested by his title, <cite>Our Benevolent Feudalism</cite> &mdash; an entertaining example of sustained sarcasm.
</p>

<p>If some of the more blatant oppressions of the Middle Ages have been removed, it is not entirely because of revolutions and social democracy. Too often, direct oppression has been replaced by more subtle ways of maintaining privilege. Indeed, the feudal hierarchy is too obvious. A century of industrial fascism (also too obvious) was followed by a half century of sociological and psychological studies, so that now we can be persuaded to welcome a streamlined <b>feudofascism</b> as protection from a manufactured &mdash; but sufficiently horrific &mdash; threat. The benefits to the 1&permil; are so carefully indirect that most are unnoticed. A perhaps unexpected ancillary benefit is that with sufficient initial chaos, the approach appears to be self-sustaining. We are a clever bunch, as Great Apes go!

<p class="epi">The bottom line is that Congress and the banking cartel have entered into a partnership in which the cartel has the privilege of collecting interest on money which it created out of nothing, a perpetual override on every American dollar that exists in the world. Congress, on the other hand, has access to unlimited funding, without having to tell the voters their taxes are being raised through the process of inflation. If you understand that paragraph, you understand the Federal Reserve System. &mdash; <a class="fn">

</p>

<p>The intent of the Constitution was that Congress should control the amount of money in circulation and thence its value {I.8.5}. The Founding Fathers understood bankers, so on 16 Jan 1791, the US Senate passed the following resolution:
</p>

<blockquote>Nor shall any person holding any office or stock in any institution in the nature of a bank, for issuing or discounting bills or notes payable to bearer or order, under the authority of the United States, be a member of either House whilst he holds such office or stock. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	CA Lindbergh (1913) <span><cite>Banking and Currency and The Money Trust</cite> (Omni Publications, Hawthorne CA): 25.
</span></a>
</blockquote>


<p>This excellent, indeed, essential, idea was &lsquo;fought by the bankers, and amended at their instigation in order that they might be allowed to sit in Congress&rsquo;, adds Congressman Lindbergh &mdash; and by 1913

<blockquote>the Finance Committee in the Senate and the Committee on Banking and Currency in the House, [were] made up of bankers, their agents and attorneys.
</blockquote>


<p class="flu">Given the carefully orchestrated transfer of T$12 from taxpayers to <a class="fn">banksters<span>
	If we had given the same amount of money to people to pay their mortgages, the banks would have gotten the same amount of money &mdash; and no one would have lost his home. This would have been castigated as &lsquo;socialism&rsquo;, which has been made taboo in the US. Giving the money to the banks did not prevent them from foreclosing, and later buying real estate at bargain prices. This is fascism &mdash; evidently not taboo. Never mind the million American casualties in WW2, fought (we thought) to stamp out fascism, when what it was really for was to remove competition for our home-grown fascists.<br>

	<i>Cui bono?</i> Who gains because we now have a lot of homeless people and empty houses? Was this simple stupidity or intentional demoralization? Are we just afraid someone would cry &lsquo;Socialism&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Fascism!&rsquo;? Have I missed some other important benefit to bankers?
</span></a> in 2008, we would be well advised to return to the original resolution, and keep bankers as far away from Washington as possible with a Constitutional amendment. If their expertise be needed, they can be subpoenaed and questioned under oath.

</span></a> Parasitism works so well that according to some estimates, 80% of all living species are <a class="fn">parasites.<span>
	This estimate seems high to me, and perhaps includes all animals as being parasitic on plants or other animals, which is something of an extreme view.

<p>The US Civil War had little to do with slavery, and was intended to destroy this &lsquo;mischievous financial policy&rsquo;.

	The question of conspiracy occurs. Greed may be a sufficient explanation of history &mdash; but coordinated greed is more logical and efficient.
</span></a> arranged the Panic of 1907, by tightening the money supply and calling in loans. The result was an uphill money flow from the poor to the rich, just as in the Panic&apos;s centennial celebration in 2008. Congressman Lindbergh said of the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, &lsquo;The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill&rsquo;. The same Paul Moritz Warburg who threatened us with the Panic and then organized it became the first Chairman of the Fed, and Andrew Jackson&apos;s &lsquo;mischievous financial policy&rsquo; was laid to rest. It had taken 70 years, but Instinct-1 is persistent, and re-creation of the feudal system was back on track.

Literacy. US relative literacy over a 50-year period, ranked against 20 high-income nations, plotted against year of high-school graduation, shows the decline described by educator John Gatto as intentional. <a class="fn">Data<span>

<p>Figure 19.3 shows that we are no longer so literate. One way this was achieved is that between 1922 and the 1940s, the <a class="fn">number of words<span>

</span></a> in the basal reader&apos;s vocabulary (Dick and Jane: &lsquo;See Spot run.&rsquo;) decreased by 45 per cent. The question of how Dick and Jane were allowed into schools is one I have not investigated. No one in my extended family of teachers would have admitted them! (As of 2013-08-27 I can no longer find Dr Grof&apos;s paper on the web. See <a href="http://www.donpotter.net/education_pages/reading-instruction.html">Don Potter&apos;s page</a> instead if you have young children in school.)
</p>

<p>Vocabulary reduction continues in &lsquo;graphic novels&rsquo; (hard-bound &lsquo;comic books&rsquo;), where the vocabulary is that of conversation, which can be a few percent of the <a class="fn">reading vocabulary.<span>
	This is not to denigrate such series as <cite>Asterix</cite> and <cite>Le Chat du Rabbin</cite>, which can be both educational and challenging &mdash; in French. (Le chat, having eaten an annoying parrot, thereafter speaks.)
</span></a> Subtleties are conveyed by facial expression and gestures, as in conversation, so a smaller vocabulary suffices for sophisticated communication.

<p class="epi">Illiterates escape certain temptations such as vacuous and vicious reading. &mdash; psychologist G. Stanley Hall.
</p>

<p>It is easy to spread illiteracy while appearing to teach a skill. All that is required is to make the skill artificially difficult. Adults read by gestalt, ignoring letters and responding to each word as an ideograph. Because of this, John Dewey and the Progressive Education Association proposed to teach gestalt reading (&lsquo;sight words&rsquo;, or &lsquo;look-say&rsquo;) to children. Unfortunately, this ignores the way that children actually <a class="fn">learn to read.<span>
	S Shaywitz (1996) &lsquo;Dyslexia&rsquo; <cite>Scientific American</cite> Nov. pp 98-104.
</span></a> Gestalt teaching destroys the advantage of the alphabet. It makes reading English comparable to reading Chinese, and results in whole-word dyslexia: If you haven&apos;t memorized the gestalt pattern there is <a class="fn">no way to discover<span>
	HJ Rowse (2005) &lsquo;Comparison of Effectiveness of Phonological and Whole-Word Treatment Programmes within Two Dyslexia Subtypes&rsquo; http://hdl.handle.net/10063/591 (as of 2013-08-27).
</span></a> that a written word is one you already know. The learned skill of detailed left-to-right scanning, with millisecond recognition of letters, plays no part in gestalt reading. Its absence makes later phonetic reading <a class="fn">difficult to acquire,<span>
	S Blumenfeld (1993) &lsquo;Dyslexia: Man-Made Disease&rsquo; <cite>Practical Home Schooling</cite> <b>#4</b>.
</span></a> creates the dyslexic b-d/p-q confusion, and makes spelling an arcane mystery.
</p>

<p>Gestalt-reading aims for 800 word-shapes memorized per year. It does not expect 4th-graders to spell difficult words like &lsquo;cat&rsquo; and &lsquo;dog&rsquo;. Neurologists assert that brains can seldom hold more than 2500 <a class="fn">arbitrary symbols,<span>
	There must be almost that many in the symbol dictionary of the <cite>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</cite>, which was a 7th-grade continuation of the Webster-dictionary process below.
</span></a> or 1/20 of a useful reading vocabulary. I (and many people I know) pored over Webster&apos;s <cite>2nd International Dictionary</cite> when we couldn&apos;t begin to lift it, learning <a class="fn">new words for <i>fun</i>.<span>
	Example: Working my way through the A-s, I came to &lsquo;aye-aye&rsquo;, with an appealing picture, so I had to look up, in sequence, &lsquo;nocturnal&rsquo;, &lsquo;arboreal&rsquo;, &lsquo;lemur&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Madagascar&rsquo;. &lsquo;<i>Daubentonia</i>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<i>madagascariensis</i>&rsquo; remained elusive, but they introduced me to binomial nomenclature, and the &lsquo;-iensis&rsquo; suffix became clear with more examples. (It would be 40 years before I got to Madagascar to meet an aye-aye, but I made it &mdash; and thought it worth the wait.)
</span></a> With pronunciation diacritics at the bottom of the page, many illustrations, and etymological derivations for most words, it was a principal way of keeping a 4-year-old out of mischief. Lack of plot was compensated by the excitement of new ideas, and one unconsciously absorbed information about the history of the alphabet, language families, the change of language with time, how complex ideas can be represented by combination of word roots, and a useful smattering of Greek and Latin roots.
</p>

<p>My mother later taught remedial reading to high-school students, and their problem was immediately apparent. Consistently, they recognized long (3 syllable!) words by prefix and suffix, and inserted whatever central root they happened to know that carried those tags. The resulting sentence seldom made sense, but they were used to that. <i>Few sentences made sense</i>, so reading was not a source of entertainment, let alone learning. It took all semester to teach smart 16-year-olds the alphabet, the sounds of the letters, and how to sound out a word letter by letter &mdash; things she had taught me <a class="fn">in a week<span>
	I triggered the teaching by asking why &lsquo;and&rsquo; had 3 letters and 3 sounds, while &lsquo;the&rsquo; had 3 letters but only 2 sounds. I had been trying to follow the text of bedtime stories by looking over her shoulder.
<br>
	This exemplifies one of Gatto&apos;s points: Everything taught in elementary school can be learned in 100 hours, if it is taught when the child is ready to learn it. This is what mothers are <i>for</i>.
</span></a> when I was 3.
</p>

<p>The real, irrevocable, damage done to those deprived kids is two-fold.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Firstly, abstract thinking is a <a class="fn">by-product of literacy.<span>
	&bull; A Luria (1980) <cite>Language and Cognition</cite> (Wiley, NYC, 1982).<br>
	&bull; WJ Ong, J Hartley (1982) <cite>Orality and Literature" 30th Anniversary Edition</cite> (Routledge, NYC, 2012).
</span></a> Oral cultures remain at the level of <a href="../_B/B05.shtml#T5.2">concrete operations</a>; only the written word freed us from the constraints of the here and now and the traditional answers of bicamerality committed to memory and proverb.
</li>

<li>Secondly, they missed a dozen developmental years wandering barefoot through the world&apos;s literature, discovering and trying new ways of seeing and responding to the world, limited to peer pressure (Ã  la <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>) and consumption-teaching TV during their formative years.</li>
</ul>


<p>One result is that while we once led the world in the proportion of 25-year-olds with college degrees, today we are 31st in the world, and many of our degree programs are the equivalent of basket weaving. Our educational &lsquo;skill level between Bulgaria and Costa Rica [means] that in 20 years [we] will also have <a class="fn">income levels <span>M Williams (2008) &lsquo;Obama&apos;s Geek Economist&rsquo; <cite>Technology Review</cite> <b>111</b>(#50) 84-87.
</span></a>between Bulgaria and <a class="fn">Costa Rica&rsquo;.<span>
	Indeed, 5 years after that prediction was made, US ranking  had fallen to 24th in rank, on the Legatum Prosperity Index&apos;s &lsquo;Economy&rsquo; category, below China (7), Malaysia (8), and Thailand (12). (Norway is 1st; There is still a way to go: Costa Rica is 40th, Bulgaria 49th.)
<br>---------------<br>
	Legatum Institute (2013) <cite>The Legatum Prosperity Index</cite> (London).
</span></a> With rising unemployment among college graduates, one may wonder about the utility of a degree. Firstly, college keeps people out of the employment market for 4 years, which is a good thing when jobs are scarce. Secondly, employability is not the point of education. The point is that without an awareness of how much effort has gone into creating civilization, and the eternal vigilance required to maintain it, we end up with people who unwittingly assist in its quiet dismembering.
</p>

<p>The <i>ultimate</i> rationale for producing illiterates is that it is a shortcut back to mindless feudalism, but in a nasty synergistic trap, the <i>proximate</i> rationale is pecuniary. A &lsquo;best seller&rsquo; is 10,000 copies. If you can make learning to read take 6 years in school (instead of a week at home), you can sell something like 6 million text books a year.

<p>Miseducating the US public to the point that it would permit the Constitution to be trashed (think &lsquo;Patriot' Act and <cite>Citizens United</cite>) without rising in rebellion required 140 years of preparative rot.
</p>


<ul>
<li>One aspect of the rot was the generation of an early antipathy to evolution, achieved by equating evolution with the predatory <a class="fn">Social Darwinism<span>
	Often blamed on Herbert Spencer, Social Darwinism is a misreading of both Darwin and Spencer, by people who can see only what they are looking for.
</span></a> siezed upon and funded by millionaires John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie to justify their own rapacity.</li>

<li>A 2nd was regional. The Confederacy&apos;s rejection of Federalism included rejection of the Enlightenment inspiration of the Founding Fathers in favor of patriarchal, Old Testament, Instinct-1, values.</li>

<li>A 3rd was the &lsquo;red scares&rsquo; of 1848 and 1919, which threatened to produce a working class aware of exploitation and determined to obtain a fair wage. Henry Ford understood that this would greatly increase the number of people who could afford his cars, but Ford was outnumbered.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">Woodrow Wilson explained the position very clearly:
</p>

<blockquote>We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks. &mdash; Woodrow Wilson.
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">Contrast Wilson with Jefferson, who saw education as a way to raise
</p>

<blockquote>the mass of the people to the high ground of moral respectability necessary to their own safety and to orderly government, and [&hellip; to complete] the great object of qualifying them to select the veritable <i>aristoi</i> for the trusts of government. &mdash; Letter to John Adams, 1813.
</blockquote>

<p>Alas, no incumbent politician wants to <a class="fn">compete with the <i>aristoi</i>.<span>
	This is a commonplace of academia. Good departments get better; mediocre ones never voluntarily hire anyone who might outshine them. The best example I know of: atomic physicist Dave Pritchard (MIT), anxious to prevent a valued postdoc from being lured away by rival institutions, but realizing that he was unlikely to get tenure without an independent research program, gave Wolfgang Ketterle a going experiment, 2 research grants, and the 2 senior graduate students that went with the experiment. As a direct result, and with the help of sophisticated equipment invented by Pritchard, Ketterle shared the 2001 Nobel Prize (Physics) with Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell, another of Pritchard&apos;s students. (Nobels are limited to 3 recipients per award, even if it took 50 people to make the discovery.) At Nobel-time, blackboards at MIT kept score: &lsquo;Berkeley 20, MIT 16 &mdash; but they buy theirs and we grow our own&rsquo;.
</span></a> &lsquo;What&apos;s wrong with a little mediocrity?&lsquo;, asked Senator <a class="fn">Roman Hruska,<span>
	The infamous quote is actually a paraphrase. Hruska&apos;s argument in defense of Supreme Court nominee Harrold Carswell was that mediocre people needed mediocre judges. Fortunately, Carswell was not confirmed, but in time, others were &mdash; and with sufficient mediocrity on the bench, corporations finally got their personhood.

Bush gave us the unforgettable answer, displacing Buchanan as &lsquo;worst president ever&rsquo; with stolen elections, unwinnable pre-emptive wars, destruction of checks and balances, wholesale kleptocracy, unqualified appointees including a Supreme Court majority of political hacks, environmental rape, and economic collapse. His Vice President Cheney and Attorney General Gonzales were charged with <a class="fn">prison profiteering<span>

	Although it galls to point it out, the caste system has proven to be a not unsuccessful way of living with strangers, so it would appear to qualify under the rubric &lsquo;religion&rsquo; (a distinction one cannot grant to Mohammatism, for instance). Whether castes were endemic among the aboriginal population of India, or, more likely, imposed by the Aryans, is moot: the formative events of the ice age never reached the subcontinent.
</span></a> The Brahmins (intellectuals) and Kshatriyas (warriors) discovered how to maintain privilege through classroom ritual. With change of target, this was what Britain needed to produce workers for the Industrial Revolution, whose duty and joy would be to work for &lsquo;aristocrats&rsquo;. The details of indoctrination are mechanisms we now take for granted: class periods, bells, regimentation, memorization, unrelated facts, multiple-choice exams, and a focus on celebrity trivia (kings, battles) rather than on central ideas. We accept this as standard pedagogy, but it is designed to shorten attention span, kill curiosity, suppress individual response, and reinforce conformity.
</p>

<p>The key is that <b><i>what</i> we teach is less important than <i>how</i> we teach it</b>. Reflecting this difference, home-schooled children are commonly 5 to 10 years ahead of <a class="fn">publicly schooled children.<span>
	This was true before the rise of Fundamentalist charter schools, which look back to the Old Testament for their ideals.
</span></a> A corollary is that a teaching credential may be a preparation for producing results which have nothing to do with education:
</p>

<blockquote>Schools were designed by Horace Mann and by Sears and Harper at the University of Chicago and by Thorndyke of Columbia Teachers College [&hellip; to produce children who are] indifferent to the adult world, incurious, &hellip; ahistorical [with] no sense of how the past has predestined their own present, limits their choices, shapes their values and lives, [&hellip; and a] poor sense of the future, of how tomorrow is inextricably linked to today, &hellip; cruel to each other, uneasy with intimacy, materialistic, dependent, [and] passive. &mdash; <a class="fn">Gatto 1992<span>

<p class="epi">Critical thinking consists of seeing both sides of an issue, being open to new evidence that disconfirms your ideas, reasoning dispassionately, demanding that claims be backed by evidence, [and] deducing and inferring conclusions from available facts&hellip; &mdash; cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham
</p>

<p>Thorndyke claimed that geometry, supposed to teach logic that could be applied to the real world, did no such thing, so he recommended dropping geometry. The intellligent response would have been to redesign the course to show how logic <i>could</i> be used in the real world &mdash; but that was decidedly not the goal.
</p>

<p>Britain is intentionally downgrading the teaching of history. 60% of schools teach no history at all, and medieval history &mdash; the story of the feudal system, when (in <a class="fn">Disraeli&apos;s words<span>
	B Disraeli (1844) <cite>Coningsby</cite> (Henry Colburn, London, 1894): Pref.
</span></a>)

&lsquo;history was unknown, the passions of societies, undisturbed by traditionary experience, were strong, and their convictions, unmitigated by criticism, were necessarily fanatical&rsquo; &mdash; has been dropped from the curriculum {<cite>GW</cite> 2009-09-18 p14}. This is intentional abusive application of Santayana&apos;s insight that &lsquo;those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&rsquo;, and a clear indication of the goal of contemporary schooling.
</p>

<p>Texas, because of the size of its textbook market, exerts an inordinate influence on the content of textbooks. Realizing this, the Texas Republican Party&apos;s platform for 2012 had this to say about education:
</p>

<blockquote>We oppose the teaching of &hellip; critical thinking skills, &hellip; which &hellip; have the purpose of challenging the student&apos;s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority. (jargon and acronyms removed)
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">Such intellectual stasis is the essence of feudofascism. Still, as a teacher, I always thought that critical thinking was the <i>purpose</i> of education.

<p class="epi">Please do not blame those of us in public schools for how unprepared for higher education the students arriving at your institutions are.  We have very little say in what is happening to public education. &mdash; Kenneth Bernstein
</p>

<p>The 8th-grade final exam from Kansas in 1895, reproduced in the <a href="#FE">Appendix</a>, suggests that we have lost 4 years of secondary schooling over the last century. Compare this exam with an interchange with my high school neighbor &mdash; and now voter &mdash; in New England (which has always aspired to intellectual leadership):
</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm headed for Germany for a couple of weeks. Can I hire you to feed the cat?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Germany? <a class="fn">Where&apos;s that?&rsquo;<span>
	His ignorance was no worse than that of vacationing US army high-school brats I met on a European train. Stationed in Europe, they still lived in the US (courtesy of the base PX), with no interest in the cultures around them, or the reasons for the Army&apos;s presence in Europe, or why the Grand Tour was once an essential part of growing up. They grumbled about the absence of real football (&lsquo;gridiron&rsquo;, rather than soccer), and were unaware of the Moors, the Alhambra, the Reconquista, and the Cid, and although headed for Barcelona, were unaware of Gaudi, Picasso, Guernica, Franco, or the Spanish Civil War. There is nothing in the curriculum that would alert them to what they have missed, and by now they are voters and, for that matter, Congresspeople, trying to run the world with what an Albanian peasant would regard as an 8th-grade education.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>I thought that was an appalling proof of educational failure, but it is not limited to the US. Ireland is no better: after the response to a rocket attack triggered international outrage directed at the recipients of the rockets, a bright Anglo-Irish 17-year-old neighbor echoed the question: &lsquo;Gaza? Where&apos;s that?&rsquo; &mdash; and this despite an older brother serving with the British Army in Iraq, and visits to family working in Abu Dhabi. Teen-agers' natural preoccupations, encouraged by social networks, You Tube, smart phones, fantasy role-playing games &mdash; and carefully miscrafted school systems &mdash; enable one to grow up disconnected from the real world and prepared to vote with the limbos.
</p>

<p>I submit that Kansas&apos;s 8th-grade test would challenge today&apos;s 12th-graders. This amounts to a loss of 2 weeks of education per year, too slow to notice, and perhaps a realistic explanation for the rise of fundamentalism.

<p>Despite constantly being told that the US is at the top of all possible measures of civilization, the categories in which we <i>do</i> rank first are listed in Table 19.3. These numbers change with time and with polls, and are gathered from assorted sources. The important aspect is not the detailed numbers, but the fact that we are not uniformly 1st, as we pretend.

<p>Congress seems unconcerned by these facts, and continues to maintain that we are Number One in all things. This is the result of spending money on the priorities of Instinct-1, while lumping all of the important issues under the forbidden rubric of Socialism.
</p>

<p>If the American Medical Association were a professional organization instead of a guild, the US ranking for infant mortality would shame its members into making <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/40661756/ns/today-today_news/" class="fn">$5 house calls<span>
	As Dr Russell Dohner of Rushville IL has done for 55 years. Lawyers and medical doctors, in particular, enjoy a higher income than other professionals of equivalent skill and education because we turn to them in time of trouble, and most take full advantage of this. My college career-adviser&apos;s suggestion to me was surgeon, something I had never considered. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;, I asked. &lsquo;You have the grades and the hands, and it&apos;s the highest paying occupation.&rsquo; I talked with a cousin who owned the hospital in an upscale California seaside town, and learned that one can be a top-ranking surgeon while possessing no imagination whatsoever, so I opted for a career in research.
</span></a> until we were number 1. That's all it would take. We don't need health-care legislation or insurance, just a little more attention to Instinct-2 in medical school, and a <i>lot</i> less to Instinct-1.
</p>

<p>Another price of inept education is revealed by the Columbia Center for the Study of <a class="fn">Science and Religion:<span>
	R Pollack (2006) &lsquo;The price of science without moral constraints: German and American medicine before DNA and today&rsquo; <cite>Cross Currents</cite> Spring 2006: 364&ndash;375.
</span></a>
</p>

<blockquote>[W]e have been pleased to find that when we have taught the facts of science to clergy, we have witnessed a transformation: understanding of the data of science enables clergy to put to rest common fears of the process of modern science. {375}
</blockquote>

<p>The embarrassing reason is that many US schools, particularly those affiliated with southern churches, do not teach the facts of science. Worse, the facts and data, however useful, are not the distinguishing feature of science. Far more important is understanding the method by which the facts are obtained and evaluated, and how data differ from dogma and revelation. Miss Lowrie, our 7th-grade science teacher in Berkeley, taught us that.

It was far from perfect &mdash; but life isn&apos;t perfect. The wounds healed, and the scars had the supreme advantage of reminding us where we stood. Grades reflected intellectual mastery of course material. The village idiot understood that he wasn&apos;t very smart, and was seldom tempted to run for public office &mdash; a benefit unappreciated until recently. A &lsquo;C&rsquo; in class was both confirmation of mediocrity and a valid suggestion of a career not to follow. It was up to the teacher to find and encourage whatever unique spark lay within each child.
</p>

<p>Eventually, psychologists noticed the consequence of encouraging unwarranted self-esteem:
</p>

<blockquote>People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but <b>their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it</b>. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	J Kruger, D Duning (1999),<span> &lsquo;Unskilleed and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One&apos;s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments&rsquo; <cite>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</cite> <b>77</b>(#6) 1121-1134.
</span></a> emphasis added.
</blockquote>

<p>This observation underpins the often remarked inverse relationship between knowledge and certainty. The fewer options you are aware of, the easier it is to see where your advantage seems to lie &mdash; an  affliction that has spread to the Tea Party and thence to Congress. It seems to have contributed materially to the banking crisis and military adventurism, and it gave us the motto of postmodernism and bloggers: &lsquo;All ideas are equally worthy of public attention!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Now it turns out that this attitude has a corollary. &lsquo;People often hold extreme political attitudes about complex policies [and] typically know less about such policies than <a class="fn">they think they do&rsquo;.<span>
	PM Fernbach &amp;3a (2013) &lsquo;Political Extremism is Supported by an Illusion of Understanding&rsquo; <cite>Psychological Science</cite> <b>24</b>(#6): 939&ndash;946; doi 10.1177/0956797612464058.
</span></a>

Asking them for a detailed mechanistic explanation undermined their confidence in their extreme view and led to more moderate attitudes. (This moderation did not occur when they were asked to explain the <i>reasons</i> for their views.) Put another way, people are more capable of intelligent analysis
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="New Idea"/></a>
when engaged in Socratic dialog, than when directly challenged or asked to justify themselves. This is an approach worth remembering.

<p>Only after I was co-opted to run for school board in Rhode Island, did I realize that a major problem was the propensity of retired teachers to run for state legislature, and devote their efforts to the fiscal welfare of their old associates. The net result was that the cost per pupil, in inflation-corrected dollars, had increased 10-fold, with the same slow nationwide decrease in knowledge transmission.

<p>Taking advantage of taxpayer resentment of the rising cost of public education, feudofascists have made privatization and &lsquo;charter schools&rsquo; the <a class="fn">facts on the ground.<span>

</span></a> In 1995 Mayor Daley delegated to Paul Vallas, an accountant &lsquo;unqualified to teach half an hour in any classroom&rsquo;, the task of reducing education costs in Chicago, with the psychopath&apos;s title of CEO. Vallas fired blacks, destroyed parent-teacher associations, closed public schools, and funded private (preferably military) schools. All of this, naturally, without input from anyone concerned with the welfare of the children.
</p>

<p>Vallas went on to do the same in Philadelphia and New Orleans, but failed in Bridgeport CT, where there was the logical requirement that school managers have teaching qualifications. One person could not have wreaked this much damage without the support of taxpayers whose children were already out of the public schools. It did not occur to these people that by the time the charter-school children were in position to run for public office, they would have been indoctrinated with the Instinct-1 dogma that money spent helping people was money wasted, and when they got to Congress, they would agitate to privatize Social Security and any other democratic institution for the general Welfare. Privatize the Profits; Socialize the Cost!

<p>I have known only a few of the people who have been mistreated in this manner, and cannot write of them from my own experience. A summary list from <cite>An Insider's View: The Dark Rigidity of Fundamentalist Rural America</cite>
</p>


<ul>
<li>Their economic situation is largely the result of voting for supply-side economic policies that have been the largest redistribution of wealth from the bottom/middle to the top in U.S. history.</li>

<li>Immigrants havenât taken their jobs. If all immigrants, legal or otherwise, were removed from the U.S., our economy would come to a screeching halt and food prices would soar.</li>

<li>Immigrants are not responsible for companies moving their plants overseas. The almost exclusively white business owners are responsible, because they care more about their shareholders (who are also mostly white) than about American workers.</li>

<li>No one is coming for their guns. All that has been proposed during the entire Obama administration is having better background checks.</li>

<li>Gay people getting married is not a threat to their freedom to believe in whatever white god they want to. No one is going to make their church marry gays, have a gay pastor or accept gays for membership.</li>

<li>Women having access to birth control doesnât affect their lives either, especially women they complain about being teenage single mothers.</li>

<li>Blacks are not âlazy moochers living off their hard-earned tax dollarsâ any more than many of their fellow rural neighbors. People in need are people in need. People who canât find jobs because of their circumstances, a changing economy or outsourcing overseas belong to all races.</li>

<li>They get a tremendous amount of help from the government they complain does nothing for them. From the roads and utility grids they use to farm subsidies, crop insurance and commodities protections, they benefit greatly from government assistance. The Farm Bill is one of the largest financial expenditures by the U.S. government. Without government assistance, their lives would be considerably worse.</li>

<li>They get the largest share of Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.</li>

<li>They complain about globalization, yet line up like everyone else to get the latest Apple products. They have no problem buying foreign-made guns, scopes and hunting equipment. They donât think twice about driving trucks whose engines were made in Canada, tires made in Japan, radios made in Korea, and computer parts made in Malaysia.</li>

<li>They use illicit drugs as much as any other group. But when other people do it is a âmoral failingâ and they should be severely punished, legally. When they do it, it is a âhealth crisisâ that needs sympathy and attention.</li>

<li>When jobs dry up for whatever reason, they refuse to relocate but lecture the poor in places like Flint for staying in failing towns.</li>

<li>They are quick to judge minorities for being âwelfare moochers,â but donât think twice about cashing their welfare checks every month.</li>

<li>They complain about coastal liberals, but taxes from California and New York cover their farm subsidies, help maintain their highways and keep the hospitals in their sparsely populated rural areas open for business.</li>

<li>They complain about âthe little man being run out of business,â and then turn around and shop at big-box stores.</li>

<li>They make sure outsiders are not welcome, deny businesses permits to build, then complain about businesses, plants opening up in less rural areas.</li>

<li>Government has not done enough to help them in many cases, but their local and state governments are almost completely Republican and so are their representatives and senators. Instead of holding them accountable, they vote them into office over and over and over again.</li>

<li>All the economic policies and ideas that could help rural America belong to the Democratic Party: raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, spending on infrastructure, renewable energy growth, slowing the damage done by climate change, and healthcare reform. All of these and more would really help a lot of rural white Americans.</li>

<p class="epi">The only security of all is in a free press. &mdash; Thomas Jefferson
</p>

<p>If the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were doing its job, we would have a free press in the US. The &lsquo;revolving door&rsquo; that allows corporate management to control Federal regulatory agencies ensures that we do not. Figure 19.4 shows the exponential decline in &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; in terms of corporate ownership. If the public is influenced by advertizing &mdash; and the money spent on it says that it is &mdash; who is influencing our opinions if all information is filtered by these few corporations? This is why you have to turn to alternative sources for anything important. As early as 1974, <a class="fn">
	Robert Ludlum <span>
	(writing as Jonathon Ryder) <cite>Trevayne</cite> (Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson Ltd, London)
</span></a>described villanous corporate efforts to buy up the media. Today 6 corporations control 90% of the US media: Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast. The last 2 are also anxious to control the Internet. </p>

(The blue line is an exponential fit: why this should be so exact is something of a mystery.) The Internet has so far escaped this control despite continuing efforts to rein it in: COICA, PIPA, and SOPA are acronyms of a series of Congressional Acts drafted by corporations (and roundly defeated by public ourcry), which attempted to control what they can&apos;t purchase, and the FCC seems determined to allow corporations to charge for connection speed.

<p>In 1998, the plot of Mark Urban&apos;s spy novel <cite>The Linguist</cite> involved installing a secret tap on an optical fiber beneath the streets of Paris. A decade later the US National Security Agency simply inserted beam splitters in the servers of Microsoft and Yahoo. They similarly gained total access to Google, Facebook, and PalTalk in 2009, You Tube (2010), Skype, AOL (2011), and Apple (2012) &mdash; and these are merely the ones that <cite>Der Spiegel</cite> learned about. Too much data to process? Not if they take an interest in something. Everything we've said or looked at is indexed and stored, Google-fashion. By 2015, Windows 10, Google, and Facebook were analyzing every use you made of their products in search of ways to manipulate your wallet. What they know, the government can access.

<p>A century ago, Instinct-1 sought to gain its ends by brute force, controlling the government (via fascism/corporatism), and using the national military to expand its markets. It failed primarily because the Monroe Doctrine &mdash; &lsquo;The Western Hemisphere is a <i>US</i> market&rsquo; &mdash; protected its own. So corporations went multinational, buying the governments (while allowing them all the trappings of democracy),
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Stop3.gif" alt="Stop!"></a>
and buying the news media (persuading the population to reward them exorbitantly therefor while keeping them misinformed and distracted).

Prescott Bush, vice president of George Herbert Walker&apos;s Union Banking Corporation (the US arm of Germany&apos;s Thyssen family bank) and a senior partner of Brown Brothers, Harriman (BBH), made it to the US Senate in 1952. Soon ex-BBH lawyer Allen Dulles was running Mockingbird, a CIA mission buying favorable press for government decisions. This subversion involved ca 500 journalists and 25 news outlets, all paid to report CIA-disseminated stories with a favorable spin.

<p>The objective of oligopoly media ownership is revealed by Sonoma State University&apos;s student-run media-research group &lsquo;Project Censored&rsquo;, who publish an annual list of the 25 most significant stories &lsquo;overlooked or underreported by national news media&rsquo;. The 45-second attention span assiduously cultivated by TV news will make most of the stories seem like ancient history, but the point is that despite the hoopla about &lsquo;Change!&rsquo; in the 2008 election, <i>nothing</i> has been done to reverse the trend made obvious by these stories.

<p class="epi">Freedom is only appreciated when lost. We are on the brink of an irreversible totalitarian multi-government regime and even though the European Parliament has stated that citizens should not have to defend themselves against state sponsored Cybercrime, the fact remains that our own governments continue to attack us in our own homes while we sleep. &mdash; &lsquo;The Adversaries&rsquo;

<p>Just as no business appreciates competition, no government appreciates democracy. Totalitarian nations make no bones about their control of the Internet, but nominal democracies must praise its independence. Nevertheless, uncontrolled citizen communication represents an essential threat to all governments, and they treat it accordingly. &lsquo;The Adversaries&rsquo;, an anonymous group of British internet-savvy hackers has reverse-engineered British Telecom's (BT) router &mdash; the box that sits between you and the internet. Its very design is psychologically targetted at discouraging you from investigating it: smooth white (&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;), no visible means of entry, no description or instructions, and (unlike other necessary components) delivered and installed by a BT technician.
</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, this approach has its purpose. There are <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/12/Full-Disclosure.pdf">60 pages</a> of technical description available, whose bottom line is that the NSA and Britain's analogous GCHQ have installed backdoors in all commercial routers that allow them to intercept traffic despite your firewalls, retrieve the keys to all your encryption protocols, and generally do anything they want to your computer.
</p>

<p>The Adversaries also suggest some countermeasures, both electronic and legal.
</p>

<p>The discovery of BT's backdoor was made in 2013, before the Snowden revelations. Not subtle, they relied upon not being looked for. The US backdoors discovered in 2014 were more subtle, so much so that they might have been simple one-line coding errors. The NSA could say (with its usual believability), &lsquo;Gosh, no. We didn&apos;t know about those!&rsquo; Competent hackers suggest that there are a couple of ex-programmers living in luxury somewhere that has no extradition treaty with the US.

Most of the award-winning proposals mentioned case studies in other countries. On one hand, perhaps it is encouraging to find DoD interested in why it gets to go to war so often. On the other hand, these are exactly the studies needed use NSA&apos;s extensive data on the US public.

<p>As early as 2003, Representative Ron Paul (Republican, Texas) delivered a speech in Congress titled &lsquo;Neo-conned&rsquo;, in which he described the beliefs of the self-defined &lsquo;neocons&rsquo;. Slightly edited, these were:

<p>Since this list has little to do with conventional conservative principles, and since, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the red entries are straight out of <cite>Mein Kampf</cite>, it seems to me that &lsquo;feudofascist&rsquo; is a more accurate label for this set of beliefs than &lsquo;neocon&rsquo;. Under whatever name, it is alive and well in Washington.
</p>

<p>What Paul failed to add is that among feudofascists of his own party there is an adamant rejection of rationality, compromise, conciliation, or cooperation for the good of the country (&lsquo;Do it my way, or we won&apos;t do it at all!&rsquo; &mdash; recall the marching song of the <a class="fn">Commissariat Camels:<span>

This is delayed infancy, a reprise of the Terrible Twos, when a baby tests the limits of his powers by blanket refusal. One has to go back to the 16th-century AbbÃ© de BrantÃ´me, chronicler of the Court of Valois, to find similar rigidity. A man of no contradictions, he &lsquo;extolled wicked and immoral characters because he recognized only <a class="fn">two merits&rsquo;<span>

</span></a> &mdash; which among today&apos;s feudofascists would be Wealth and Hatred of Democrats.
</p>

<p>A dozen years later, George Monbiot described the results of <i>Neoliberalism</i> &mdash; the philosophy promoted by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek &mdash; and endorsed by the Reagan-Thatcher crowd:
</p>

<blockquote>Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that&lsquo;the market&rsquo; delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning.<br><br>

Attempts to limit competition are treated as inimical to liberty. Tax and regulation should be minimised, public services should be privatised. The organisation of labour and collective bargaining by trade unions are portrayed as market distortions, that impede the formation of a natural hierarchy of winners and losers. Inequality is recast as virtuous: a reward for utility and a generator of wealth, which trickles down to enrich everyone. Efforts to create a more equal society are both counter-productive and morally corrosive. The market ensures that everyone gets what they deserve. &mdash; <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/04/15/neoliberalism-zombie-doctrine-root-all-our-problems">G Monbiot (2016)</a>
</blockquote>

<p>How odd that serious thinkers would not see that competition and a free market are the last things that corporations want; that consumers need disposable income to support a market, with organization as powerful as the prodoucers&apos; to obtain it; and that any single criterion of merit (such as wealth) will produce a criminogenic culture devoted to its maximization! Did Apollo&apos;s &lsquo;Nothing in excess&rsquo; never reach Austria?

<p class="epi">[E]mployers used the [2008] downturn to dump entire departments and reorganize themselves so that the same work, the same jobs, requiring the same skills, would henceforth, in good times and bad, be done by [part-time] workers [without employment benefits]. One sign of that: during the course of the Great Recession corporate profits went up by 25%-30%, while wages as a share of national income fell to their lowest point since that number began to be recorded after World War II. &mdash; <a class="fn">

</span></a>
</p>

<p>Setting the stage for that accomplishment required a deeper philosophical basis than Paul&apos;s description, perceptive as it was. It took an emotional commitment that went beyond the alpha male&apos;s obvious wish for government for the benefit of the elite, empowerment of his corporations, and a place on the podium as his enforcers marched by. It could not be satisfied by &lsquo;the American Dream' &mdash; the realistic vision of a nation so open that it could accomodate freedom of speech and worship, with the economic power to provide freedom from want and fear. It needed to feel superior; a condition it understood to mean having a rabble it could look down on. Lacking this, there was a sense of fractured destiny, of a rip in the fabric of history that needs mending.
</p>

<p>Suppose that you knew that you came from an aristocratic bloodline that the accidents of history had reduced to a position in the top 1&permil; (one among 300,000), so that you were expected to <i>pay</i> taxes rather than receive them. You know this is not right, and that the world has gone downhill since &mdash; well, since its mythic high point when the stalwart Barons of Britain emasculated the Crown at Runnymede. Life under the Magna Carta was as good as it gets. (There may have been Dark Ages on the Continent, but never in feudal England.)
</p>

<p>Later, however, there were blunders. Enlightenment philosophers emigrated to the New World, so that before long, the American colonies objected to control by the Bank of England and its transfer of profits from colonies to motherland. The resulting war, instead of being a profit-making enterprise, was lost along with the colonies, which then imposed an obnoxious populist Constitution that ignored hereditary privilege.
</p>


<p>While the subsequently engineered Civil War failed to divide the country, it nevertheless served its purpose:
</p>

<blockquote>As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few and the Republic is destroyed. &mdash; Abraham Lincoln
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, we succeeded in sidelining such warnings as &lsquo;conspiracy theories'. Opportunities of the 19th-century frontier gave rise to the fortunes of the <a class="fn">robber-barons,<span>
	The Stanford football team long had an Indian mascot. But Native Americans objected, leaving the team at a loss for an appropriate name. While the president of the university eventually decided upon &lsquo;Cardinals&rsquo; &mdash; their team color &mdash; an irreverent historian suggested that &lsquo;Robber Barons&rsquo; would honor the university founder most appropriately.
</span></a> and although FDR and the New Deal set us back a generation, by 1970, the problem was reduced to regaining the lost feudal prerogatives while preserving the faÃ§ade of an ostensibly democratic society. With persistence, incremental steps, and the appropriate economic system, this was not difficult. First, as a matter of course, is to keep the country in a position to exploit the rest of the world. The well oiled Military-Industrial Complex accomplishes this in spades, and needs only to be better funded. Beyond that:

<li>If they want justice, we appoint the judges.</li>

<p>We are accustomed to the leaders of failed states &mdash; and politicians with the ethics of used-car salesmen &mdash; using the apparatus of democracy to stay in power, yet we pretend this doesn&apos;t happen in English-speaking democracies. The Constitution&apos;s checks-and-balances were meant to keep government honest; not anticipated was how many office seekers would be motivated entirely by Instinct-1, without the slightest concern for public welfare, and how quickly totalitarianism would return once all branches of government were in the hands of the far right, and how easy it would be to count the votes creatively.

This means that after miscounting the results of a polling place, &lsquo;losing&rsquo; one ballot prevents analysis of the count, and the original (miscount?) stands. This is very convenient if one plans to tamper with an election! A proper law would analyze the miscount and its effect on the outcome.
</p>

<p>There are too many possible cases to analyze here, but the recount should proceed. (The only logical reason to object to a recount is fear that your manipulations will be caught.) It is then up to statisticians to decide whether the errors are random, biased, or mixed. Random recounts can be added together. Biased results point to the guilty party, which should then automatically lose the election. Mixed results narrow the search for guilty individuals, for whom the old punishment of &lsquo;burnt, beheaded, and hanged&rsquo; is fitting. although bleeding-heart liberals will probably settle for tar, feathers, and a rail, or permanent loss of suffrage and the right to participate in future elections.

</p>

<p>Bush reputedly won the election &mdash; by 537 votes in Florida, 1 in the electoral-college, or 1 in the Supreme Court. The legal waters were so successfully muddied by the Governor of Florida (Bush&apos;s brother) and its Secretary of State (co-chair of his election campaign) &mdash; that rational discussion is impossible and only legal minutiae or high principles are relevant. On this point I yield to Jack Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment, Yale Law School, who suggests a particular kind of bias at work here:
</p>

<blockquote>The distinction is between the &lsquo;high&rsquo; politics of political principle and the &lsquo;low&rsquo; politics of partisan advantage. [&hellip; T]he five conservatives [of the Supreme Court] seemed to adopt whatever legal arguments would further the election of the Republican candidate. &hellip; It is one thing to entrench one&apos;s constitutional principles through a series of precedents. It is quite another to entrench one&apos;s ideological allies by directing the outcome of a presidential election. &mdash;  <a class="fn">
	JM Balkin (2001)<span> &lsquo;Bush v. Gore and the Boundary Between Law and Politics&rsquo; <b>110</b> <cite>Yale Law Journal</cite> 1407.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Gore received a majority of the popular vote, 50,999,897 to 50,456,002. Exit polls predicted a Gore victory. Ballot counting in Florida did not. Gore requested a selective recount in 4 counties. Bush sued to stop the recount &mdash; a clear indication of guilt. The 5/4 Supreme Court obligingly ordered the recount to stop, a subservient and dishonest partisan ploy. Later recounting by the National Opinion Research Center showed that under <i>any</i> honest scenario of counting, Gore won the Florida election and the Presidency. And none of the felons involved were even charged.
</p>

<p>This raises an interesting question. If the election itself is invalid, are subsequent Presidential actions legal? Practically, we probably need to pretend that they are, but it is hard to find logical support for the idea. I suspect that a strong-willed president with an honest majority vote behind him could simply wipe the Bush legacy off the record with an executive order supported by an opinion from the Justice Department.

</p>

<p>Irregularities in the 2004 election were much more visible. In  Florida, part of the fraud was by simple spreadsheet manipulation. To understand what happened, and how we know, we start with Fig. 19.5. If everyone voted as registered, the results from each voting district would fall somewhere on the heavy 45Â° line. The dot represents a district with a 3-fold Democratic majority, so that 25%&ndash;75% = &ndash;50%. A 20% Republican swing would move that dot straight up to the 20% line. To move it into the upper left quadrant would require a landslide 50% defection.
</p>

Basis graph for voting anomalies. The 45Â° line represents the ideal case of voting as registered. Light lines are vote-switching percentages. Directions on this graph indicate: Right = register Republican, Left = register Democrat; Up = vote Republican, Down = vote Democrat. The dot on the 45Â° line thus represents a heavily Democratic district, voting as registered.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>Now we are ready to look at the results. The left-hand graph of Fig. 19.6, with a probability beyond reasonable doubt, represents the votes as cast; the right-hand shows the votes as reported. The difference between the 2 graphs is that the circled votes were flipped vertically across the x-axis: a result achieved by switching columns in a spreadsheet. The count was stored on an unprotected PC with neither guards nor passwords, so any teenager could have made the switch in a few minutes. This is such an egregious anomaly that any honest election supervisor would have caught it without a graphical aid, and a <i>competent</i> supervisor would use such aids as a matter of course.

<p>The mean 1st-world discrepancy between exit polls and ballots rarely exceeds 0.5%. Such polls are used by the UN to monitor the fairness of elections in 3rd-world countries.
</p>

<p>A discrepancy larger than, say, 1.5% is <i>prima facie</i> grounds for criminal investigation. The 3-month delay between a presidential election and inauguration is sufficient time to sort things out, so there is no justification for premature calls in the heat of the moment, whether by Fox TV or the Supreme Court. <b>Haste is an admission of guilt.</b>
</p>

<p>Moving beyond my personal knowledge, it appears that similar anomalies favoring Bush occurred nationwide; according to statisticians, this might occur by chance once in <a class="fn">662,000 elections.<span>
	SE Freeman, J Bleifuss (2006) <cite>Was the 2004 Presidential Election Stolen? Exit Polls, Election Fraud, and the Official Count</cite> (Seven Sisters Press, NYC).
</span></a> There were 6 US elections with significant exit-poll discrepancies: Republican primaries in New Hampshire in 1992, Arizona in 1996, and Florida in 2000, and the 1988, 1992, and 2004 presidential elections. Curiously, 5 of the 6 discrepancies favored a Republican named George Bush {116}. This suggests 2 decades of development of a nation-wide vote-stealing system with special attention to swing states such as Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Local officials must have been involved in each state: the requirement for simultaneous &lsquo;adjustment&rsquo; of the votes across the nation means that it couldn&apos;t have been accomplished by a flying &lsquo;fraud squad&rsquo;. We are led to consider nation-wide corruption of voting officials.
</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the US population currently votes with machines whose manufacturers &lsquo;have failed to meet minimum expectations of impartiality, honesty, freedom from conflict of interest, and transparency&rsquo; {195}. The problem may be an ancient one: <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>, but that is all the more reason to try to do better.
</p>

<p>Perhaps vote fraud is so common at the local level that it averages out over the country. This is unlikely to be the case in a national election. The President takes an oath to uphold the Constitution in the future (if not the past) &mdash; but one who is elected by fraud is unlikely to reform once he is where he has connived to be. G.W. Bush notoriously resented the Constitution. Vote fraud in a national election is treason, and should be punished by tarring, feathering, running out of town on a rail, and hanging the responsible parties at the nearest crossroad.
</p>

<p>Bleeding-hearts won&apos;t like that, so how about a handicap system? Get caught fiddling the vote,

<br>-----------------------<br>
	This, to my surprise, is a highly controversial statement. As a teen-ager in the 1940s I read something now unretrievable &mdash; a decade before <cite>I.F. Stone&apos;s Weekly</cite>, but similar &mdash; that gave Admiral H.E. Kimmel&apos;s side of the story; detailed 13 points of a 14-point Japanese diplomatic message received and decoded the day before Pearl Harbor, ordered the burning of papers, and obviously led to the 14th point as a declaration of war; and discussed the unavailability of Secretary of War Stimson, who was, by agreement with Roosevelt, unreachable on a golf course prior to the attack. Having been the scapegoat for Pearl Harbor, Kimmel defended himself as having followed what few orders he received, and pointed out that none of his requests for more information were answered, and none of the promised PBY Catalinas necessary to implement the orders (&lsquo;extend air patrol&rsquo;) arrived. Stinnett&apos;s book supports Willey&apos;s poorly edited account and takes advantage of access to Naval records sequestered for 60 years. Victor gives a calm assessment, noting the prevalence of command deception in US history.<br>
	Books by Stephen Budiansky, Edward Drea, and David Kahn maintain the nonsensical official story of a perfidious and wholly unexpected attack.
</span></a> in Washington.

The attack cost 2403 lives and 18 <a class="fn">obsolescent warships<span>
	Roosevelt, ex-Secretary of the Navy, had sent some of the newer, faster ships to the Atlantic, where they were quietly spotting German U-boats for the British, and the rest on an excersize well south of Pearl Harbor.
</span></a> on Sunday &mdash; and generated a million volunteers for military duty on Monday. (For comparison as military strategy, the 1916 &lsquo;Big Push&rsquo; across the Somme cost 420,000 casualties in 4 months without achieving the 1st day&apos;s objective.) Pearl Harbor, considered as a stratagem ordered by the Commander in Chief, sacrificed a pawn to gain a winning advantage. This is why we entrust &lsquo;absolute prerogatives&rsquo; to the president. It is also why we should require some qualifications before electing the president.
</p>

<p>The difference between &lsquo;justified deception&rsquo; and &lsquo;pathological lying&rsquo; is that deceit should be acceptable after the fact: &lsquo;Would I have done that, knowing what he knew?&rsquo; Many historians see Pearl Harbor as justified deception.

<p class="epi">In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was <a class="fn">planned that way.<span>
	What follows is also more controversial than I realized. I was in Ireland on 9/11, without TV or newspaper, and so a bit detached from the US response. In Robert Redford's 2007 film, <cite>Lions for Lambs</cite>, Tom Cruise plays Senator Jasper Irving, who &mdash; while he understands Mohammatism much as I do &mdash; probably has a clearer picture of the US response to 9/11:<br>

	&lsquo;Remember how petrified we were at what our enemies might do for an encore? And how all at once, everything was at risk? Families, friends, kindergartens, the rivers and bridges, nuclear plants. Do you remember how terror colored that next morning in shades we&apos;d never seen?&rsquo;<br>

	That was not my response (nor that of my email friends in the States). My response was puzzlement. Buildings didn&apos;t collapse that neatly without help. Buildings 6 and 7 apparently self-destructed in sympathy with 1 and 2. No Moslem group was capable of coordinating the multiple US organizational failures required for success. Little things noticed on TV (in pubs) <i>did not fit</i> the ever-changing official story. Something worse than Al-Qaeda was at work. There was reason to fear &mdash; but logic placed the object of that fear at the core of our own government.
</span></a> &mdash; Franklin D. Roosevelt.

<p class="epi">[T]he entire continuum of public and private life in the United States has been transformed by 9/11, the lengthy preparations for it, the ensuing cover-up, and the massive consolidation of authoritarian policies and institutions achieved in its wake. In short, I maintain that unless this phenomenon is exposed at its roots, the fundamental changes it has wrought will become permanent. That would constitute the death of the American republic. &mdash; <a class="fn">

<p>Judging by the blogs 15 years after the event, many people affected by 9/11 feel that it is somehow disrespectful of the dead to question the official story. I do not understand this reaction: were I so affected, my principal interest would be to talk with Dick Cheney in the presence of a waterboard.
</p>

<p>There are 2 conspiracy hypotheses about the collapse of the World Trade Center, both involving groups with agendas that they knew were unacceptable to rank-and-file Americans. The first hypothesis holds that as a way to advance their agenda:
</p>

<blockquote>[A] handful of young Muslim Arabs who could not fly airplanes &hellip;, outwitted not only the CIA and the FBI, but also all 16 US intelligence agencies and all intelligence agencies of US allies including Israel&apos;s Mossad, which is believed to have penetrated every terrorist organization &hellip;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition [&hellip; they] outwitted the National Security Council, the State Department, NORAD, airport security four times [&hellip; and] air traffic control; caused the US Air Force to be unable to launch interceptor aircraft, and caused three well-built steel-structured buildings, including one not hit by an airplane, to fail suddenly &hellip; as a result of limited structural damage and small, short-lived, low-temperature fires that burned on a few floors. &mdash; <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=25339" class="fn">

</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The second hypothesis maintains that a different group understood the need for a &lsquo;catastrophic and catalyzing event &mdash; like a new Pearl Harbor&rsquo; to frighten people into accepting <a class="fn"><i>their</i> agenda;<span>
	The Project for the New American Century (2000) <cite>Rebuilding America&apos;s Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century</cite> (PNAC, Washington DC): 51.
</span></a>
that members of this group were later in positions to organize such an event; and that they did so.
</p>

<p>The agendas are justified by manifest destiny in the eyes of their proponents. They are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fight the unbelievers around you, and let them find harshness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him {Quran 9:123};</li>

<li>Continued American geopolitical leadership and military preeminence {PNAC:69}.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is only in the details of implementation &mdash; such as the attack on the Twin Towers &mdash; that these agendas become recognizable as equally obnoxious. An immediate response to the attack &mdash; cynical but <a href="http://www.meforum.org/3285/islam-sodomy" class="fn">realistic<span>
	I do not discount Moslem desire for, or pleasure and participation in, 9/11. The question is how much domestic assistance they had. A more typical outcome for a sophisticated but unaided Moslem attack was the 2009 Christmas-day fiasco on Northwest flight 253 (Amsterdam&ndash;Detroit). 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, following an Al-Qaeda plan, attempted to explode 80 grams of pentaerythritol (about half a hand-grenade) sewn into his underwear (see Ibrahim (2012)  for an unexpurgated report on this incident), succeeding only in setting his pants on fire.

	A certain US incompetence is also visible here: Umar&apos;s father had alerted the US Embassy in Nigeria of his son&apos;s radical associates, but his name was not added to the list of 15,000 who must be carefully screened, nor was his US visa revoked.

<ul>
<li>Moslems were delighted by the fall of the Towers;</li>

<li>Some interested parties have the ability to manufacture any sort of evidence, including sophisticated image manipulation and peer-reviewed journal articles;</li>

<li>The official investigation deliberately avoided numerous legitimate questions, at the behest of its White House observer.</li>
</ul>

<p>One event, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Cause_of_change_in_U.S._debt_position_2001-2011.png" class="fn">2 agendas,<span>
	Subsidiary agendas include:<br>
	1) Terrorists win when we overreact. The 20 million Muslim refugees and displaced people created by the chaos we triggered are likely to supply 3 million jihadi recruits.<br>
	2) Wars move wealth uphill; banks thrive on debt. In 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected a G$5.6 surplus by 2011; the actual result was a G$6.1 deficit. The surplus disappeared into Bush&apos;s tax cuts, discretionary spending, interest payments, and &lsquo;other&rsquo;; the deficit is attributable to the economic chaos of 9/11, the banksters of 2008, and MIC-wars. [Click for CBO data.]
</span></a> botched investigation. How to decide? Since, if anything, both obvious agendas were set back by the attack and its aftermath, how are we to decide between the hypotheses? There seem to be 3 ways.

</p>

<p>The classical police criteria of <i>means, motive, and opportunity</i> are described in 650 methodical (even plodding) pages, suitable for submission to a grand jury, in <a class="fn">
	Michael Ruppert&apos;s<span> <cite>Crossing the Rubicon</cite> (New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island BC, Canada, 2004) http://sandiego.indymedia.org/media/2007/01/124770.pdf

</p>

<ul class="u3">
<li><b>Means:</b> The Secret Service sees the same radar screens as FAA, and has the  authority to take command in cases of national emergency. During President Bush&apos;s photo-op in a Florida elementary school, Dick Cheney was acting Commander in Chief on 9/11, meaning that he had operational control of FAA and NORAD, responsible for interception of hijacked planes, and is on record as taking no action as the 2nd plane approached New York.</li>

<li><b>Motive:</b> Dick Cheney was aware of what the coming Peak Oil crisis would mean to the US. 9/11 provided the pretext for the series of energy wars that Cheney stated &lsquo;will not end in our lifetime.&rsquo; [Recall 2007 Item 24 above.]</li>

<li><b>Opportunity:</b> Under Dick Cheney&apos;s control, the Air Force was running multiple war games on 9/11, simulating hijackings including a &lsquo;live-fly&rsquo; exercise, and simulations that placed false blips on FAA radars. The war games and terror drills successfully <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_594949&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=paWiZ2Y8fRg&amp;v=AeGabzkDmm4" class="fn">confused<span>
	One of the drone pilots, simulating a terrorist attack  by flying his plane into a building, is reported as saying of the display on his console, &lsquo;This is great special effects! We've never had this before!&rsquo;
</span></a> NORAD interception attempts, which were delayed and misdirected.</li>
</ul>


<p>While this summary mentions only Dick Cheney, Ruppert expressly indicts others:
</p>

<blockquote>I have &hellip; chosen to do what any good police officer must do; keep my eye on the suspects. It does not take a scientist to prove that George Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condi Rice, General Ralph Eberhart, General Richard Myers, FBI Director Robert Mueller, John Ashcroft and George Tenet lied to the American people [about 9/11]. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	M Ruppert (2004)<span> <cite>Address to the Commonwealth Club</cite> 2004-08-31.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the inability to challenge his facts, 2 reasons are commonly given for denying Ruppert&apos;s detective work. People who have not had personal experience with psychopaths are apt to claim, &lsquo;The government would never do anything so despicable.&rsquo; It would: Read &lsquo;Operation Northwoods&rsquo; on the web, or James Bamford&apos;s <cite>Body of Secrets</cite> and the declassified material therein to see just how expendable people are to our government.
</p>

<p>The other reason given is that no conspiracy could be kept secret. Yet:</p>

<ul>
<li>130,000 people kept the Manhattan Project secret for the necessary 4 years.</li>

<li>Kennedy&apos;s trade of US missiles in Turkey for Russian missiles in Cuba was kept secret for <a class="fn">16 years.<span>
	Alterman, E (2004) <cite>When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences</cite> (Viking Penguin, NYC): 151.
</span></a></li>

<li>The existence of the massive National Security Agency remained unknown for 30 years.</li>

<li>NSA&apos;s Project Shamrock, tapping transatlantic telegraph cables with the cooperation of the communications carriers, was kept secret from the 1940s to the 1990s.</li>

<li>Whistle-blower Edward Snowden&apos;s documents showed that the NSA had been spying on the EU for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/us-senate-intelligence-officials-nsa" class="fn">at least a decade.<span>
	&lsquo;The NSA has previously claimed that 54 terrorist plots had been disrupted &lsquo;over the lifetime&rsquo; of the bulk phone records collection &hellip;. On Wedneday [2013-07-31, NSA deputy director John C.] Inglis admitted that at most one plot [$8000 sent to a Somalian tribal organization] might have been disrupted by the bulk phone records collection alone.&rsquo;
</span></a></li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">Ruppert suggests &lsquo;the number of people with complete foreknowledge of the attack of September 11th would likely not exceed two dozen&rsquo; &mdash; all agreeing with its goals and strategy, as they had before being appointed by George W. Bush to positions where they could implement them.

</p>

<p>I have not read the NIST corpus, primarily because none of the abstracts addresses the questions uppermost in my mind. Watching the Towers collapse on Irish TV, I observed simultaneous orange flashes through all windows of a floor several stories ahead of the collapsing rubble. I learned later that these are known as &lsquo;demolition rings&rsquo;: explosives triggered (with a delay) by the shock wave from an earlier ring, to shear columns ahead of the collapse, enabling the rubble above to descend at near free-fall velocity.

<p>Does it surprise you that I suspected the demolition of the Towers to have been carefully planned? As one who once perused National Traffic Safety Board aviation-accident reports on the job, I wonder why these, and similar mandated analyses of construction accidents, were omitted from the <cite>Report</cite>. The &lsquo;failed&rsquo; steel columns were shipped to China as scrap metal without study.

<p>A couple of unexplained facts (there are many others):</p>

<ul>
<li>BBC correspondent Jane Standley described the collapse of the<a href="http://wtc7.net/bbc.html"> Solomon Brothers' Bank (Building 7)</a> (unhit by any airplane) 23 minutes before its actual collapse, with the standing building visible behind her as she spoke. (The 3 buildings that collapsed that day are the only 3 steel-frame buildings ever to collapse from &lsquo;fire damage&rsquo; &mdash; and the only 3 insured against terrorist attacks.)</li>

<li>Pools of molten steel in the underground floors (first detected by satellite infrared), survived until October. <i>Nothing</i> in the official story is hot enough to melt steel. Officials fully cognizant of legal requirements that debris from building collapse be inspected continued to ship steel columns to China despite repeated requests from reporters and family of victims. &lsquo;The outright refusal of city officials to desist from recycling the steel again raises serious questions about the <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/destruction-of-evidence/">intent of their actions</a>.&rsquo;</li>

<p>There are many problems with the airplanes of 9/11. The government confiscated ~80 security-camera tapes of whatever hit the Pentagon. Airport surveillance tapes are routine for all flights, but &lsquo;unavailable&rsquo; for all of the 9/11 flights.
Wallace Miller, the Somerset County Coroner, said of the Pennsylvania site of the &lsquo;crash&rsquo; of United flight 93, that it looked as though someone had dug a 40-foot ditch (the plane was 115 feet long) and dumped some scrap metal in it, and that he was unable to find any body parts or so much as a drop of blood. There had been a small fire, but no fireball, no sign of 19 tons of jet fuel, no structural parts of a 757, no piece of debris too big to fit in a pocket, but a lot of unburned mail with California addresses. Work on the site stopped on 9/17, and subsequently, drivers&apos; licenses, passports, pages from the Quran, a &lsquo;terrorist check list&rsquo;, tickets, and receipts belonging to the terrorists were found by the FBI, along with 600 pounds of human tissue that hadn&apos;t been there earlier. In the same vein, presumed hijacker Satam al-Suqami&apos;s

<blockquote>passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit, about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The tower collapsed shortly afterwards. The detective then gave the passport [back?] to the FBI on 9/11. &mdash; <cite>9-11 Commission Report</cite>: p40n109.
</blockquote>

<p>One problematic aspect of the official story is that the airplanes of the day were not deregistered until much later, as shown in Table 19.4. Another is that <a class="fn">official data<span>
	DT Hartwell (2012) <cite>Planes Without Passengers</cite> 2nd ed. ISBN: 978-1478339748.
</span></a> show that 2 of the planes did not fly on 9/11, and the other 2 were still flying over the Midwest <a class="fn">after the &lsquo;attack&rsquo;.<span>
	When I attempted to investigate this with offshore email, BTS gave me only the canned explanation that the planes had flown but the data were missing because in the fog of catastrophe, the <i>airlines</i> involved had neglected to fill out the forms for the day. This is not the case: it is precisely in a catastrophe that the data is important, so the <i>airport</i> records the data when the plane takes off &mdash; before there is any catastrophe to befog the situation. Investigators on the spot found the story reported here.
</span></a>
</p>

<blockquote>According to Bureau of Traffic Safety (BTS) statistics both flights [11 and 175] officially never took-off on 9/11, as well as showing no elapsed run-way time, wheels-off time and taxi-out time. However, Flights 11 and 77 on both 9/10 and 9/12 had all the recorded data properly logged. &mdash; <a href="http://www.rense.com/general68/doomed.htm">G Szymanski

<p class="epi">That patriotism may degenerate into a vice is shown by the invention of a name for the vice: chauvinism. It is a name for boastful and truculent group self-assertion. It overrules personal judgment and character, and puts the whole group at the mercy of the clique which is ruling at the moment. It produces the dominance of watchwords and phrases which take the place of reason and conscience in determining conduct.

<p> The other approach to deciding between conspiracy hypotheses is to see who benefited. Neither <i>avowed</i> agenda profited immediately.
</p>

<p>An analysis of the <a class="fn">effectiveness of terrorist attacks<span>
	M Abrahms (2006) &lsquo;Why terrorism does not work&rsquo; <cite>International Security</cite> <b>31</b>(#2): 42&ndash;78.
</span></a> showed partial achievement of their goals in only 3 out of 42 attacks. The paper then developed a theory &lsquo;derived from the social psychology literature for why terrorist groups that target civilians are unable to compel policy change&rsquo;, and tests it against 3 high-profile cases in which terrorists failed to achieve announced goals. Unremarked by the author, in 2 of these cases, the attacks had the opposite effect of consolidating opposition to the terrorists' goals, and benefitting their opponent. In the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings by putative Chechen nationalists, the attacks raised support for military action against the Chechens from 19% to 71%.
</p>

<p>One has to ask about such &lsquo;counter-productive&rsquo; terrorism: Who could most easily organize it? 9/11 did not help Saudi Arabia (the home of most of the named terrorists); it certainly did not help Iran or Afghanistan or bin Laden (who had nothing to do with it). The new owner of the Twin Towers managed to get his insurance claim paid twice, but the most obvious &lsquo;benefit&rsquo; from the attack was that it raised President Bush&apos;s popularity from 50% to 90%, and greatly facilitated goals of the Project for a New American Century such as the ill-advised adventures in the Midddle East, and the legitimation of the US police state, which did not receive public attention until 2014.
</p>

<p>If it had been the Arabs, and they wanted to damage the US economy (rather than a perceived symbol), they would have hit Wall Street. The buildings destroyed on 9/11 (particularly the one not hit by an airplane) were notable for housing official investigations &mdash; and their data &mdash; that would have severely embarrassed the 1&permil;.

<p>It would be trivial to establish the factuality of the official story if it were true. If it were my story, <i>and true</i>, and I wanted people to believe it, I would:</p>


<ul>
<li>Release the confiscated videos of the object that hit the Pentagon.</li>

<li>Release the data from the flight and cabin recorders reputedly recovered (3 out of 4 &lsquo;black boxes&rsquo;) from the debris of the Towers.</li>

<li>Publish the names of those who placed (profit-making) put options before the attack.</li>
</ul>


<p> Instead of taking these simple steps, Obama&apos;s choice to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, suggests that the appropriate response is pure feudofascism: the government should infiltrate and discredit activist groups that question the official story (a suggestion that does nothing at all to get at the truth, or to bolster the reputations of Harvard&apos;s Law School or the President!).
</p>

<p>Sunstein&apos;s response is predictable if (1) the 3 steps above would discredit the official story, and (2) one believes that determined manipulation will permanently <a class="fn">hoodwink the public.<span>
	There is data to support the effectiveness of hoodwinking: 25 years after Tienanmen Square, most Chinese do not know what happened there, and do not recognize iconic photos like the Tank Man that are known across the world.

<p>An interesting concept to come out of the debate about 9/11 is &lsquo;a dangerous possibility long overlooked by social scientists&rsquo;, the SCAD, or State Crime Against Democracy, &lsquo;defined as concerted actions or inactions by public officials that are intended to <a class="fn">weaken or subvert<span>

</p>

<blockquote>Official investigations have often attributed assassinations, election fiascos, defense failures, and other suspicious events to such unpredictable and idiosyncratic forces as lone gunmen, ricocheting bullets, antiquated voting machines, bumbling bureaucrats, and innocent mistakes. In effect, the government has answered <i>conspiracy theories</i> with <i>coincidence theories.&rsquo;</i>

<p class="flu">Why would any public official be against democracy? G.W. Bush ingenuously gave the definitive answer: &lsquo;If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as <a href="http://whitehouse/gov/news/releases/2004/08/20040805-3.html" class="fn">I'm the dictator&rsquo;<span>

<p class="epi">No other society in human history has imprisoned so many of its own citizens. &mdash; <cite>California Prison Focus</cite>

<p>Cornell's edX course &lsquo;American Capitalism: A History&rsquo; celebrates capitalism as a constantly changing historical process which single-handedly takes credit for
</p>

<blockquote>a massive revolution in the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth century in transportation &hellip; clothing &hellip; communications &hellip; construction &hellip; energy &hellip; and shopping &hellip;. The average life expectancy of Americans surged from 37 years in 1800 to 47 years in 1900. Early capitalism led to early democracy in England (1863 Second Great Reform Act), France (1871 Third Republic) and the expansion of the franchise to women in the United States (1920). &mdash; in the words of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/02/the-demonization-of-american-capitalism/">Jonathan Adelman</a> (not mentioned by the course).
</blockquote>


<p class="flu">An alternative insight might be that the driving force behind the transformation was the exponential growth of knowledge and freethought since the Enlightenment, and that every one of the accomplishments listed by Adelman would have occurred under a cooperative system like <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#19">Mondrag&oacute;n&apos;s</a>, without the century of <a class="fn">Dickensian misery.<span>
	It is impossible to substantiate this sort of counterfactual claim. Some exploitation may have been inevitable at the start of the Industrial Revolution, simply because the only source of finely directed energy available at the time was human labor. <i>Today</i> Mondrag&oacute;n holds its own against capitalist competition, so there is no excuse for feudofascism except greed. And the pure exaltation of being the master race.
</span></a> The course&apos;s vision is straight out of the <a href="https://mises.org/" class="fn">Austrian School:<span>
	Lv Mises (2011) &lsquo;The ?Rise of Capitalism&rsquo; <cite>Mises Daily</cite>
</span></a> &lsquo;[Capitalism] soon transferred political power from the hands of a privileged minority into the hands of the people&rsquo; &mdash; an oversight now corrected by the voting machines of 2004/2008 and <cite>Citizens United</cite>.</p>

<p>Or perhaps mass production transformed a largely superfluous <i>hoi polloi</i> into a class of consumers by giving them employment, who then achieved political power in the effort to reduce their exploitation at the hands of the owners of the machines. The classical problem of economics is the division of surplus value (ie, profits, interest, rent) between those who produce it (workers) and those who own the resources used in production (capitalists). The urge of manufacturers to gain market share with low prices leads them to minimize worker pay, but Henry Ford saw that the more workers were paid, the larger the market to be shared (and in 2015, Dan Price, CEO of a credit-card company in Seattle) proposed to pay his workers $70,000/year (twice a professor&apos;s salary, in my experience). 200 years after Adam Smith, there is still no rational theoretical basis for the division of surplus value, nor have I found attempts to model the optimum distribution. Rousseau, summing up the social compact between these two estates of men, quoted in anticipation the 21st-century Republicans:

<blockquote>You have need of me, because I am rich and you are poor. We will therefore come to an agreement. I will permit you to have the honour of serving me, on condition that you bestow on me that little you have left, in return for the pains I shall take to command you. &mdash; <cite>The Social Contract and Discourses</cite>: 162.
</blockquote>

<p>A more meaningful assessment of capitalism begins with the first topic of Cornell&apos;s course: American slavery, touted as a &lsquo;reorganization to make optimum use of resources&rsquo;. There is a feeling that after the Civil War, investment in tractors and cotton gins made slavery uneconomical, allowing the Southern economy to survive Emancipation handily. This is not the case. Slavery continued in the liberal-approved mode of convict workers. What, after all, is more likely to rehabilitate a criminal than work experience, learning a useful trade instead of sitting idle in a jail cell?
</p>

<p>But <i>Capitalism corrupts</i>: A few years after the Civil War, the jails of the South had doubled the number of Black convicts, and were leasing them to employers to replace their slaves. Today AT&T, Boeing, Compaq, Dell, IBM, Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent, TWA, and the US Army &mdash; among many others &mdash; take advantage of this modern version of slave labor.
</p>

<p>Judges were bribed; sentences were lengthened. The Republican urge for &rsquo;smaller government&lsquo; is code for &lsquo;Privatize the Profit; Socialize the Cost&rsquo;: in this case, private for-profit prisons, with occupancy guarantees so that taxpayers continue to pay ~$25,000 per bed-year, occupied or not. In the interest of capitalist profit, the US locks up 7 or 8 times as many people per capita as Western Europe, and most of them are <a class="fn">African-Americans and Hispanics,<span>
	V Peleaz (2014-03-14) &lsquo;The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business or a New Form of Slavery?&rsquo; http://www.globalresearch.ca/author/vicky-peleaz.
</span></a> jailed under the long sentences for Breathing while Black (BwB) crimes popular in Southern states.
</p>

<p>One solution to this problem is to run the deserving among our politicians through the private prisons. The hope is that they would then realize the point of John Rawls&apos;s &lsquo;<a class="fn">veil of ignorance&rsquo;,<span>
	J Rawls (1971) <cite>A Theory of Justice</cite> (Belknap Press, Cambridge MA) ISBN 0-674-00078-1.

<p>The Second Amendment gave us the right to keep and bear arms as part of a well regulated State militia, this being a natural response of a people who had just freed themselves by an armed Revolution. Chief among the benefits of that Revolution was a Bill of Rights, protecting individuals from an overzealous central government. Scholars and the NRA gun lobby both recognize that the Second Amendment was seen as necessary to protect our Constitutional gains.
</p>

<p>Today, however, this approach seems less useful. Our ~300 million household guns cause 30,000 unintentional domestic deaths a year, 10,000 of them our children. Some suggest that this too high a price, since other advanced nations keep the gun toll down to 1% of ours. A minor problems overlooked in current justifications of a domestic armory is that small arms are not particularly effective against militarized police, let alone the Army. The major difficulty is that our rifles did nothing at all to protect the Bill of Rights, and no one has suggested the obvious step of applying the rifles to the people who wrote the Patriot Act that Congress passed without reading.

<p>The fundamental changes made by the &lsquo;Patriot&rsquo; Act to specific Articles in the Bill of Rights include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="st">Freedom Of Speech:</span> Government may prosecute librarians or keepers of records if they tell anyone that the government subpoenaed information related to anything it chose to call a terror investigation. (Article 1).</li>

<li><span class="st">Freedom Of Association:</span> Government may monitor religious and political institutions without suspecting criminal activity to assist anything called a terror investigation. (Article 1)</li>

<li><span class="st">Freedom From Unreasonable Searches:</span> Government may search and seize Americans' papers and effects without probable cause to assist anything it calls a terror investigation. (Article 4).</li>

<li><span class="st">Right To Liberty:</span> Americans may be jailed without being charged. (Articles 5)</li>
<li><span class="st">Right To Confront Witnessess:</span> Gone. (Article 6)</li>

<li><span class="st">Right To Legal Representation:</span> Government may monitor federal prison jailhouse conversations between attorneys and clients, and deny lawyers to Americans accused of crimes. (Article 6).</li>

<li><span class="st">Right To A Speedy And Public Trial:</span> Government may jail Americans indefinitely without a trial. (Article 6).</li>

<li><span class="st">Freedom Of Information:</span> Government has closed once-public immigration hearings, has secretly detained hundreds of people without charges, and has encouraged bureaucrats to resist public records requests. (Freedom of Information Act).</li>

<li><span class="st">Posse Comitatus:</span> This is the law (18USC1385, enacted after post-Civil War abuses) that bans the military &mdash; with its tanks and flame-throwers &mdash; from police duties such as suppressing peaceable assembly. It has effectively been nullified by a 20-year series of executive orders. The Army is once again available for use against its own civilians. Police forces now recruit discharged combat soldiers, and outfit them in jackboots and armor. As the manslaughter of students at Kent State showed, US soldiers ordered to fire on crowds that might contain their own children will do so.</li>

<li><b>Midnight Laws:</b> Removal of environmental regulations &mdash; effective in the last week of the outgoing Administration as Bush tried &lsquo;to leave a legacy that supports his ideology [of a] free market and conservative agenda&rsquo; &mdash; include: 800,000 hectares in the Rocky Mts opened to oil-shale strip mining; 20,000 hectares near Utah&apos;s Delicate Arch natural bridge for oil drilling; Clean Water Act exemptions for mines, and cattle- and pig-farms; power plants relieved of air-pollution laws; and government agencies freed from Environmental Impact Assessments {<cite>GW</cite> 2008-11-28 p8}.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering that a major purpose of the American Revolution was to outlaw similar British abuses, it is a pity that Congress panic'd and blindly passed the Patriot Act. Even worse is that on 2013-09-13 a bill, HR 2818, to repeal the Patriot Act died in the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Combined with George W. Bush&apos;s characterization of the Constitution, the Patriot Act seems a carefully orchestrated coup rather than a measured response to <a class="fn">terrorism.<span>
	Most of the 30,000 rounded up by FALCON to fill Homeland Security&apos;s Detention Centers were not terrorists, but apparently harmless homeless people whose absence would raise no questions and indeed, please local politicians.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>A strong case can be made that the 9/11 uproar confused cause and effect; that the Patriot Act was not the response, but the objective. Recall the <a class="fn">long association<span>
	WG Tarpley, A Chaitkin (2004) <cite>George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography</cite> (Progressive Press, Joshua Tree, CA).
</span></a> of the Bush family with Fritz Thyssen and his Union Banking Corporation, &lsquo;universally recognized as the most important German financiers of Adolf Hitler&apos;s takeover of Germany&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Remember the preposterous assumptions of Orwell&apos;s <cite>1984</cite>? They're here. Obama is the first US president to have argued for, and gotten the Supreme Court to grant (by inaction), the power to declare someone an unperson:
</p>

<blockquote>The court let stand an earlier opinion by the D.C. Circuit Court, which found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act &mdash; a statute that applies by its terms to all &lsquo;persons&rsquo; &mdash; did not apply to detainees at Guantanamo, obligingly ruling that the detainees are not persons at all for purposes of U.S. law. &mdash;
	<a href="http://antiwar.com">Wm Fisher, 2009-12-16</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from a president sold as a Constitutional lawyer, this amounts to a concerted bipartisan assault on principles that our ancestors <a class="fn">shed blood<span>
	To the best of my knowledge, the Swamp Fox of the Revolutionary War was a collateral (?) ancestor.
</span></a> to establish by law. This is not what we <a class="fn">hoped for from him!<span>
	Perhaps we should have realized that<br>
&bull; Obama would never have been nominated without the blessing of the feudalist power elite, and <br>
&bull; A constitutional lawyer will understand how most easily to circumvent the Constitution.
</span></a>


Note the perverse anomaly here: we deprive people we don&apos;t like of the right to personhood &mdash; and grant it to amoral corporate fictions whose primary legal responsibility is to make money for stockholders.

<p>The US Constitution owes a fundamental debt to <a class="fn">
	Montesquieu&apos;s (1748)<span><cite>The Spirit of the Laws</cite> (Batoche Books, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, 2001)
</span></a> analysis of government, particularly for his endorsement of the Separation of Powers. Oddly, he is beloved of retrograde conservatives for 3 ideas:

<blockquote>First, Montesquieu required republican governments to maintain limited geographic scale [interpreted as State&apos;s Rights]. Second, Montesquieu required republican govtrnments to preside over a univocal people of one creed and one mind on most matters [fundamental Christianity]. A &lsquo;res publica&rsquo; is a public thing valued by each citizen, after all. &lsquo;How could this work when a republic is peopled diversely?&rsquo; the faithful Montesquieuan asks. (Nowadays in America, for example, half the public values <a class="fn">liberty<span>
	&lsquo;Liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit&rsquo; &mdash; Montesquieu XI,3. To conservatives, it seems to mean no taxation
</span></a> and the other half values equality, its eternal opposite.) Thirdly &mdash; and most important &mdash; Montesquieu mandated that the three branches of government were to hold three distinct, separate types of power, without overlap. &mdash; <a href="http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2013/12/us-constitution-mis-correcting-montesquieu.html" class="fn">

</span></a> one sees the appeal of &lsquo;limited geographic scale&rsquo;. A &lsquo;univocal&rsquo; state is more problematic.

<p>Still, Montesquieu also says things dear to the conservative heart, such as &lsquo;Nothing contributes more to the preservation of morals than an extreme subordination of the young to the old&rsquo; (V,7). I find him consistent only on the assumption that he had remarkably <a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#De">progressive parents</a>. This is not true of all conservatives.</p>

<p>To return to the separation of powers, Montesquieu first establishes the need for checks on power:
</p>

<blockquote>[C]onstant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go. &hellip; To prevent this abuse, it is necessary from the very nature of things that power should be a check to power. (XI,4)
<br>In every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the [judicial] in regard to matters that depend on the civil law.
<br>When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.
<br>Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. (XI,6)
</blockquote>

<p>Contrary to Gordon&apos;s argument, Montesquieu then devotes many pages to examining ways in which the corners of the triangle can interact to check the abuse of power. His recommendations are not precisely the ones devised by Madison for a government unlike any that Montesquieu analyzed.
</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the Montesquieu-Madison triangle (on the left of Fig. 19.5) &mdash; although currently dysfunctional &mdash; is the best we have done. It manifestly needs repair (as the Senate needs serious recruiting to recover from its current <a class="fn">&lsquo;moral bankruptcy and intellectual incompetence&rsquo;).<span>
	WT Wheeler (2009) &lsquo;Eliminate the Senate&rsquo; <cite>Counterpunch</cite> 2009-12-31.
</span></a> Britain, facing similar problems, has &mdash; after 150 years of discussion &mdash; removed the Law Lords from Parliament and put them in a Supreme Court. The Law Lords had &lsquo;already carved out an independent role for themselves as enforcers of the law and upholders of human rights, <i>often in </i><a class="fn"><i>direct conflict</i><span>
	M Kettle (2009) &lsquo;Bagehot has finally got his way&rsquo; (<cite>GW</cite> 2009-08-07 p21, emphasis added.)
</span></a> <i>with the instincts of the elected parliament&rsquo;</i>. In such conflict lies what possibility we have of maintaining a working democracy.
<p>

<p>A large part of the current failure lies in Gordon&apos;s misapprehension that &lsquo;liberty&rsquo; and &lsquo;equality&rsquo; are eternal opposites. Both are needed, in moderation, for a functioning society. If there are not civilized constraints on liberty, equality is impossible. People are <i>not</i> equal except in law, but the differences are not as large as we like to pretend. Both upper and lower economic rewards must be reasonable if society is to function smoothly.

Checks and balances. <b>Left:</b> Political: our system had a long history of thought and experiment behind it before it went into the US Constitution. It  works reasonably well unless the Legislature and Executive are of the same party, and the Executive&apos;s Daddy appointed the Judiciary with the consent of a corrupt Senate, but it clearly needs protected whistle-blowing at its center. <b>Right:</b> Socioeconomic: an incomplete version that needs further work in aid of implementing Mongrag&oacute;n principles. Designing procedures for the vacant arrows will require multiple conversations &mdash; and another Montesquieu wouldn&apos;t hurt.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The 3 corners of Fig. 19.7 should be equally powerful, with Ecclesia limited to Eirenic (social) and Gaian (ecological) issues &mdash; but with teeth. If Business is efficient in its use of resources and energy, and creates products that improve life for people, profit will follow. If one&apos;s working day is rewarding, productivity will be high, with no real need to fight over the spoils. Labor and Business between them might never make stewardship or equality a priority, although these are our ultimate concerns, so even with ideal industrial relations, there is need for the 3rd corner of the triangle.
</p>

<p>Mongrag&oacute;n&apos;s 10% levy on profits replaces shareholder participation, wealth concentration, and the Ponzi-scheme need for eternal growth imposed by capitalism. The corporation&apos;s singular duty to consider <i>shareholder</i> benefits vanishes in favor of <i>social</i> benefits.</p>

<p class="epi">Studies show that half of management decisions fail. &mdash; consultant Margaret Benefiel
</p>

<p class="epi"> [The church] in its major part [is] an opponent still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in the world. &mdash; Bertrand Russell
</p>

<p>Benefiel&apos;s epigraph tells us 2 things. Firstly, the exorbitant rewards claimed by management are unearned income, purely cosmetic. (In the extreme case that the decisions were all binary Yes/No decisions, they could be decided by flipping a coin, with no net effect on corporate success.) Secondly, decisions could be improved by more attention to external expert advice.
</p>

<p>Given the relative success of the Montesquieu-Madison triangle, it might not hurt to think about the &lsquo;socioeconomic&rsquo; triad on the right of Fig. 19.7. Its <i>Ecclesia</i> is not the &lsquo;the whole Christian religious tradition throughout history&rsquo; of Christian usage. It is an amorphous concept that aspires to improve upon its eponym, the democratic &lsquo;assembly of ancient Athens during its Golden Age&rsquo;. The religious aspect focusses on stewardship of the Earth, and a fair division of the spoils of commerce &mdash; ideas with deep (if often neglected) roots in the Abrahamic religions.
</p>

<p>We have, after all, 2000 years of experience to add to Athen&apos;s, and should be able to do better. For inspiration, we have the ecological awareness of the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and Nature Conservancy; the guidance of Gautama, Zoroaster, and UN GA 77; the activism of Ralph Nader, Paul Watson, Aaron Swartz, Michael Ruppert, and Anonymous; and the conscience of Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange. While Instinct-1 and its feudofascists can think only of eliminating such influences, as a society we should find formal ways to make use of their talents and insights. Being a renegade and criminal in the eyes of the government is no disgrace: every one of our Founding Fathers qualified.

<p>Analogy may have led us into uncharted waters here, because the socioeconomic triangle is looking at changes more fundamental than Constitutional. The absolute dominance of the BUSINESS corner, and its complete corruption of the political triangle, is the triumph of Rothschild&apos;s monetary system.
</p>

<p>When we consider the church&apos;s penchant for Inquisitions and witch-hunts, and the joy which the thought of burning/beheading infidels inspires in fundamentalists, we rightly fear any hint of theocracy. Still, misbehavior is not a <i>necessary</i> aspect of religion, but a consequence of co-option by Instinct-1, and an arrogant dismissal of the advice of Zoroaster and Thomas Aquinas about accepting the results of science.
</p>

<p>The checks and balances of the political triangle, having had 2500 years of refinement, are so familiar that the corporate world has learned to manipulate them every one. Techniques for balancing the socioeconomic triangle have less history of thought and experimentation behind them, and I, alas, am neither Montesquieu nor Madison. I venture to rethink the functions of the corners, but perforce leave some of the sides blank except for <a class="fn">question marks,<span>
	Once upon a time, I attended a Small Business Conference. The leader began by asking us why we wanted to start a business, and while I was formulating something distantly related to &lsquo;efficiency and innovation&rsquo; in coherent terms, an oaf in the back of the room shouted, &lsquo;To make money!&rsquo;. &lsquo;RIGHT!&rsquo;, said the instructor. This is certainly the lowest common denominator to which globalized business descends, but since the days of Cadbury&apos;s Chocolate (Founder John Cadbury, a Quaker, &lsquo;campaigned for justice, equality, and social reform, putting an end to poverty and deprivation&rsquo;), thoughtful entrepreneurs have tried for something better. Even Google aspired not to be evil in its youth.
</span></a> where we should long since have had working procedures. The inclusion of environmental concerns is very recent, and may require an order of magnitude more information and wisdom than we are accustomed to. The triangle &mdash; incomplete though it be &mdash; is a claim that <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#19">MondragÃ³n</a> is not forever out of reach of the US.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Instinct-1&apos;s efforts to destroy unions show that they are an essential component of civil life. The perennial fascist wish of big business to run the whole show is best evaluated by Margaret Benefiel&apos;s epigraph: for all of their back-patting, management decisions are no better than random &mdash; and even that typically requires bending the laws and resorting to unsavory practices. The &lsquo;judicial&rsquo; corner of the socioeconomic triangle has long been occupied by secular quangos to some extent, so we include them along with Ecclesia.
</p>

<p>The 6000-member quorum of the Athenian Ecclesia proved too unwieldy for voice votes, which cast a pall over direct democracy that still exists. But the advent of smart phones suggest a way around unwieldiness, and improvements in statistics and communication suggest that <a class="fn">direct democracy<span>
	It would not be surprising if apps enabling immediate and secure analysis of group votes by smart phone showed up, followed by hacks to take control of the results, followed by better encryption algorithms, followed by &hellip;
</span></a> is workable. We know this from under-reported <a class="fn"> polls in 2004,<span>
	by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland.
</span></a> which found that &lsquo;a <a class="fn">large majority<span>
	N Chomsky, D Barsamian (2005) <cite>Imperial Ambitions: Conversations with Noam Chomsky on the Post-9/11 World</cite> (Penguin, London): 135.
</span></a> &hellip; favored signing the Kyoto Protocol, accepting the International Criminal Court, relying on the UN to take the lead in international crises, &hellip; and very strongly opposed the bipartisan consensus on preemptive war&rsquo;. About <a class="fn">80% support<span>
	Chicago Council on Foreign Relations (2004) &lsquo;American Public Opinion and Foreign Policy&rsquo; <cite>Global Views 2004</cite>: 14
</span></a> universal health care and 70% favor increased aid to education and Social Security. <i>All of these choices are better than decisions made by Congress.</i> Given &lsquo;our&rsquo; representatives' fiscal and moral debts to their backers, their bad decisions are not news.
</p>

<p>The discovery that they are deliberately misrepresenting us suggests that they are doing what they are paid to do &mdash; and their government salaries are not their principal income. This is grounds for <a class="fn">recall<span>
	Once the jewels in California&apos;s Progressive checks and balances, <i>Recall</i> (&lsquo;dis-electing&rsquo; an errant representative), <i>Referendum</i> (direct voting on citizen-proposed legislation), and <i>Initiative</i> (citizen-originated legislation), were introduced in the 1920s to counter the malign influence of robber barons. They do not always work as hoped. When I left California for grad school, it &lsquo;boasted the best public schools, colleges, highways, and healthcare in America, [but] now has some of the worst&rsquo; {TG Ash, <cite>GW</cite> 2009-09-25 p20}. The reason is its &lsquo;eccentric version of direct democracy&rsquo; and abuse of the initiative by pressure groups, among them teachers&apos; and prison guards&alpos; unions.
</span></a> (which we unfortunately do not have at the national level). More importantly, it is grounds for once again rethinking representative democracy, which is clearly failing us. These polls invalidate its classical rationale: &lsquo;we-the-wealthy-elite know what is best for you-the-unwashed&rsquo;. This is good news, for it shows that even under a steady barrage of government- and business-oriented disinformation, <i>hoi polloi</i> are sometimes capable of <a class="fn">rational decisions.<span>
	Under the influence of corrupted elections and unreported news, I had begun to despair of this. The more complete the disinformation campaign, the harder it is for <i>hoi polloi</i> to make good decisions, and the more important an education in civics and a free and uncontrollable internet become.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Because fascism is as bad for people as theocracy, the wall between Business and State should be as sturdy as the one separating Church and State. We have been remiss here, allowing Business to field 2400 lobbyists in Washington to oppose legislation countering global heating, according to the Centre for Public Integrity {<cite>GW</cite> 2009-03-13 p8}. While lobbyists exist in the public sphere and can be counted, the money at their disposal is more elusive. it is also reasonable to assume that the secretive groups beloved of conspiracy theorists &mdash; among them, Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission (300+ members: US, European, Japanese), Chatham House (British think-tank, whose 30 senior advisers are equally divided between government officials, bankers, and CEOs), Council on Foreign Relations, and ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council, where businessmen present legislators with the laws they would like passed) &mdash; are, considering the names of the &lsquo;<a class="fn">power elite&rsquo;<span>
	Mills, CW (1956) <cite>The Power Elite</cite> (Oxford).
</span></a> associated with them, more influential in the politico-economic sphere than mere governments. The consensus-seeking mode of such groups, is a fine way of arriving at international agreements, and not difficult if all concerned are driven by Instinct-1; it is the nature of the agreements that is the point of contention. &lsquo;Official bodies should be put in the position of ratifying what had been jointly prepared in advance&rsquo;, explained <a class="fn">one member:<span>
	H Sklar (ed.) (1980) <cite>Trilateralism</cite> (South End Press, Cambridge MA): 171.
</span></a> this was the point of the &lsquo;Fast Track&rsquo; No-Publicity, No-Debate approach to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Fascist priorities &mdash; power, wealth, and self-preservation &mdash; run contrary to the world&apos;s needs for social justice, economic equality, affordable health care, and environmental recuperation. Democracy, and any progress toward open, transparent, responsible government requires that the State be as insulated from fascism as from theocracy.
</p>

<p>Better education of the working class (just the opposite of Wilson&apos;s approach) is probably where we have to start. We spend 1/4 of our working years on the job: if that time doesn&apos;t contribute to satisfaction and growth, it is a life wasted. Granted, someone has to do society&apos;s dirty jobs &mdash; but I've never met a Yalie Bonesman whose understanding of reality wouldn&apos;t have been improved by a few years collecting garbage. The &lsquo;iron law of wages&rsquo; guarantees that without corrective legislation, wages will drop to subsistence levels whenever there is surplus labor. Globalization let us look everywhere for surplus labor, and gave Business a free ride. Automation and increased productivity should have led to a 4-hour work day, so something is clearly wrong. France, having gotten the workday down to 7 hours, is now <a class="fn">trying to raise it.<span>
	It is an occupational hazard of college professors that we feel that life is a parade of constant self-improvement, because this is what we see in everyone we know (<i>pace</i> certain tenured exceptions). There are vast hinterlands filled with people whose mental ambit spans 7 topics only &mdash; women, cars, women, guns, women, sports, and women &mdash; and I have worked beside them. I ask only that they not be trapped by the system, as was <cite>Jude the Obscure</cite> in Thomas Hardy&apos;s novel.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>We are perilously close to utopiagenesis here &mdash; a task usually best left to novelists. The problem is that my ideas for filling in the question marks of Fig. 19.5 might need tempering. As an example for the upper right diagonal (since no oil company has yet learned not to foul its own drill fields), I would suggest a CIA/Mossad type hit squad anxiously waiting to collect the Board of Directors of a polluting oil firm, and their families, fly them to the site of their mistake, strip them, and roll them in company pollution. Then what? Do we leave them tarred, naked, penniless, surrounded by people whose environment they have ruined? Or do we feather them (to make them less sticky) and parade them on rails down Wall Street to the accompaniment of explanatory verses by a folk-poet? Or leave the wives and rail-ride the Board members? Whichever, the point is that everyone in senior management should live knowing that such public entertainment is once again available. &lsquo;Naming and shaming&rsquo; has no effect on sufficiently shameless people, but I think we might profitably remind Wall Street that &lsquo;bonds&rsquo; once tied malefactors to &lsquo;stocks&rsquo; where those whom they had defrauded could pelt them with rotten cabbages. New York might develop this into a profitable participatory tourist attraction.

<p class="epi">The love of money is the root of all evil {1Tim 6:10}, quoting Diogenes the Cynic.
</p>

<p class="epi">Calvin Beisner of the Cornwall Alliance, a Religious Right group that specializes in promoting pollution, has been well paid by the Kochs and other polluters to say things like: &lsquo;[to believe in climate change] really is an insult to God &hellip; and it will eventually lead to tyranny.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Despite the importance of fractional-reserve theft to your budgetary problems, and the fact that it is one of the most successful con game that Instinct-1 has invented, there may be a lingering feeling that in this book it is an economic detour. However interesting, it seems to have no relevance to religion. This is not the case.
</p>

<p>It is remarkable how little attention Christians pay to the epigraph. This verse should be the center of doctrine, because it is manifestly more efficient to go after the root of evil than to pursue its many expressions one at a time. One might replace all of Paul&apos;s exhortations by focusing on this one problem.
</p>

<p>As Christians may have noticed, I have had something to say about Paul&apos;s mythology, but have so far barely mentioned the contribution of Jesus. This is because most of his message was presaged by the earlier Axial thinkers. Only now has his unique and essential addition to ethics become relevant: <b>The solitary occasion on which Jesus resorted to violence {John 2: 14&ndash;16} was when he took a <a class="fn">bull whip<span>
	The &lsquo;small&rsquo; in &lsquo;scourge of small cords&rsquo; in John 2:15 does not refer to the size of the whip, but comes from the name ÏÏÎ¿Î¹Î½Î¹Î¿Î½ (a diminutive) of the plant from which it was made. Jesus was, after all, driving sacrificial sheep and oxen out of the temple as well as money-changers. Elsewhere, ÏÏÎ¿Î¹ Î½Î¹Î¿Î½ is often translated as &lsquo;rope&rsquo;.
</span></a> to the bankers of </b><a class="fn">the day.<span>
	They were not even fractional-reserve bankers, but mere money changers who made their profit from a commission: 25% pilferage compared to today&apos;s bankerly 1000% grand theft.
</span></a> Most Christians find it difficult to raise the dead, or even turn water into wine. The most practical way to emulate Jesus &mdash; and &lsquo;no man cometh unto the Father but by me&rsquo; {John 14:6} &mdash; is to start with small steps. It takes strength, skill, and panache to remove a bankster&apos;s ear with a 4-m bull whip, but anyone can use a cat-o'-nine-tails, and they are <a class="fn">easy to make.<span>
	Distinguish carefully between bank employees and banksters. The manager of a local branch bank is little more than a den mother, and may not understand how fractional-reserve banking functions. Employees at this level do not share in the loot.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>By all logic, the elimination of bankerly parasitism should be the overriding goal of the Christian church. If whipping seems extreme, you are arguing with Jesus, not with me. If banksters stay out of reach, the least the churches should do is to <a class="fn">spread the word,<span>
	<cite>The Creature from Jekyll Island</cite> is discounted in quantities from 2 up, to help spread the word.
</span></a> until the social status <i>and self-image</i> of our bankerly parasites drops to that of colon-dwelling <i>E. coli</i>.

<p>Church attendance is falling wherever churches have become irrelevant. Perhaps the way back is to notice that education, truth, justice, honesty, and personal growth are <i>ultimate concerns</i> with real-world consequences, perhaps even more important to the soul than the psychological benefits of worship.
</p>

<p>Fundamentalist churches seem to have taken &lsquo;political activism&rsquo; to mean support for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone who professes a personal anthropomorphic god;</li>
<li>Enthusiasm for guns and hunting;</li>
<li>Encouragement of homophobia;</li>
<li>Criminalization of all abortion.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">This may be what the congregation wants to hear, and it may be what brings in the contributions &mdash; but what do these things have to do with religion&apos;s purpose of learning to live together peaceably? What, for that matter, do they have to do with anything in Christian scripture?
</p>

<p>Political activism by the church should begin with defense of the First Amendment. When politicians start tinkering with freedom of speech, we are only a semicolon away from exceptions to the free exercize of religion. It will be difficult to respond to 1 Tim 6:10 when disparaging a bankster in a private email results in incarceration as a terrorist.
</p>

<p>The &lsquo;moral&rsquo; concerns of religion fall in 3 categories. We might rank them in order of descending importance as public, personal, and private:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li><b>Public morality</b> is primary because it affects everyone, encompassing the integrity of the <b>media</b>, the honesty of <b>economics</b>, the fairness of <b>health</b> care, the transparency of <b>politics</b>, the incorruptibility of the <b>law</b>, and the truthfulness of <b>education</b> &mdash; or, more pointedly, the <i>lack</i> of these qualities. Detected lapses should result in a flood of complaints from every church in the affected jurisdiction. Notice how much effort the Old Testament prophets spent scolding politicians for their moral deficiencies! </li>

<li><b>Personal morals</b> are secondary: our behavior toward others, and the presentation of working examples, are legitimate areas where hebdomadal exhortations are not amiss.</li>

<li><b>Private moral</b> decisions are <i>private</i>. The pulpit should provide advice when asked about things like sexual preference and reproductive decisions, but the advice should be tempered by awareness that both scientific knowledge and world conditions have changed in the last 8000 years. Sexual preference of ambisexuals can be moderated, but that of heterosexuals and homosexuals is equally firm. A fetus &mdash; recall that the soul (should it exist) enters with the first breath, as it leaves with the last &mdash; is an asset to a Neolithic tribe with high mortality, but perhaps not to a world of 7 billion people, facing what appears to be a resource-limited population crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out Zoroaster&apos;s essentials (<a href="../_D/D14.shtml#T14.1">Table 14.1</a>, or the end papers  &lsquo;Z&rsquo; in Chapter Navigation) for ideas about relevant church projects, and notice particularly the headline prohibition of debt. The banksters can&apos;t harass us &mdash; as individuals or as a nation &mdash; if we are not in debt to them.

<p>This exam was found in the Salina library. It has a few topical and parochial questions which might cause problems today, but these will obviously have been covered in class. My impression (from having worked alongside them in California and Ohio in the &apos;50s &mdash; and surely both states are a notch above Kansas, education-wise?) &mdash; is that the average US blue-collar voter today would fail this exam.
