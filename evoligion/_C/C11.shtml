<p>What sort of creature was it that evolved into religious humans? What did we have, as we entered the Urzeit (ca 40 ka), that turned into religion?

<p>Between the branching of the orangutan and the gorilla, about 7 million years ago, the Common Ancestor (Fig. 11.1) was a quadrupedal arboreal (largely vegetarian) primate whose DNA differed from ours by a mere 2.6%. The human/chimpanzee/bonobo clade, unlike other social animals, is characterized by matrilocal males who stay in natal groups probably no larger than a few dozen, forming closely related male &lsquo;clans&rsquo; with closed social networks, ethnocentric and xenophobic, who cooperate to defend the common territory, leading to hostile and male-dominated intergroup relationships with stalk-and-attack interactions, sub-group formation for foraging, fission-fusion female exogamy (so genes and behavior will spread to other groups rapidly) and a lack of alliance bonds between females, males having sexual relationships with more than one female, moderate sexual dimorphism (unlike gorillas) because in group conflicts it is numbers rather than individual size that is <a class="fn">most helpful,<span>

<p>A number of the preadaptations of the human/chimpanzee clade seem to encourage group aggression. According to Jane Goodall these include cooperative group living, group territoriality, cooperative hunting skills, weapon use, the intellectual ability to make cooperative plans, xenophobia (&apos;see a stranger, kill it!&rsquo;), ritual post-intergroup-conflict resolution via cannibalism, and downright cruelty. More speculatively, she suggests cultural training of warriors, and tribalism, in which a strong sense of group identity distinguishes <i>us</i> from <i>them</i>. The last is illustrated by the splitting of the Kahane chimpanzee community, upon which former friends became enemies in a ritual switch, apparently as instantaneous as <a href="../_B/B07.shtml#03a">Scatcat&apos;s</a>. The level of violence in intra- and inter-group conflicts is dramatically different. Intragroup fights generally last a minute or two; intergroup fights last 20 minutes. Intragroup injuries are bites and blows; intergroup injuries include dislocations, flayings, and  <a class="fn">drinking of blood.<span>

<p>For simplicity, let us subsume all of the above tendencies into the characteristics of the alpha male. Rambo &mdash; apparently the most universally recognized icon of our time &mdash; epitomizes the primordial alpha male, because all males carry these same instincts, and will express them if given the chance. Civilization has made available many more subtle expressions, and we will examine them in due course. For now, it is enough to recognize that this set of instincts exists for a specific reason, best illustrated by an anecdote.

<a class="tri" href="#02">&#9651;&emsp;&emsp;</a>
<a href="#TOC"   id="03"> Tule Elk </a>
<a class="tri" href="#04">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Recall the 200 million bison of the Great Plains slaughtered in the 1870s as part of the eradication of Native Americans. Pronghorn and tule elk were similarly abundant in California&apos;s Central Valley. All but 6 elk were eaten during the Gold Rush; these survivors were granted a 1000-acre preserve in 1932, and by the late 60s, the California Fish and Game (CFG) people felt that 300 elk were too many, and called a &lsquo;cull&rsquo;. The Friends of the Tule Elk complained, and I made a computer model of the herd.
</p>

<p>Real predators succeed in 10&ndash;25% of their attacks, and they pick off the least fit. This was the mode of early human hunters also. In contrast, today&apos;s hunters invariably want a &lsquo;trophy&rsquo;. Even in a 1-animal-per-license cull, if their kill is unimpressive, they will nag CFG until they get a 2nd chance. A reasonable hypothesis was that the elk &lsquo;cull&rsquo; would remove exactly the wrong animals, and permanently impair the fitness of the herd. Astonishingly, this difference was not understood by CFG, who stated firmly that &lsquo;a predator was a predator&rsquo;. A hunter with only a knife, or even a bow, is a predator; if he goes after a prey with a 50% chance of killing him, he is a sportsman; but a hunter with telescopic sights on his rifle is merely a butcher.
</p>

<p>I put the available field work and avatars of the 6-survivors and into my <a class="fn">computer model.<span>
	Because such details matter, I should mention 2 things. First, the model was discrete, tracking individual animals throughout their life span, with statistical details taken from field observation. Second, &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; in the model was 50% heritable and 50% random, not because of new mutations, but because allele distribution during meiosis is unpredictable. (However, the ratio itself is unknown, and an educated guess.) &lsquo;Adjusting&rsquo; the model consisted of modifying life expectancy and breeding particulars until it reproduced the 100-year population history of the herd. From abroad, I can no longer access the University of California Master&apos;s Thesis that provided the field data; my computer model is long gone and was never published; and I apologize for not being able to credit whomever did the field work.
</span></a> When the computer-herd&apos;s growth history matched the detailed history of the real herd, and the herd had grown to 300 animals, the computer killed off the best animals in quantities thought good by CFG, and reported what happened to the mean fitness of the herd. Naturally, I expected to see a serious decline after the hunt.
</p>

<p>I was right &mdash; and wrong. Killing 25% of the elk, fittest first, created a serious dip in mean fitness for a few years, but then things returned to <a class="fn">normal.<span>
	Models that tell you something you didn&apos;t expect are often more trustworthy than those that agree with your preconceptions. It is easy for the subconscious to arrange for the latter to happen.
</span></a> How? By the herdmaster&apos;s alpha-male strategy. In breeding season, he stays awake for 3 weeks, siring half of the calves before he drops from exhaustion and indifference. In any milieu where physical fitness is the primary component of survival, the herdmaster&apos;s strategy is optimal. I tried to explain to the Friends of the Elk that the hunt would not do permanent damage, but Iâm afraid they thought Iâd sold out to the <a class="fn">hunters.<span>
	Nowadays there are elk herds in a number of locations, and birth control keeps numbers within the carrying capacity. This is neutral toward most aspects of fitness, but nevertheless, the proper predators for the elk are <i>Felis concolor</i>, the puma, and <i>Canis lupus</i>, the gray wolf.
</span></a> Behavior which I learned decades too late, and which would have halved the recovery time, is that the fittest females come into estrus first.
</p>

<p>As we move to social species closer to humans, alphas appear to look for more in life than sex. Among primates, symbolic battles become important. Power (dominance by intimidation) saves energy and avoids wounds. Humans who seek power often believe they do so &lsquo;for its own sake&rsquo;, but this is too abstract. They seek it unconsciously because it gives them access to females. Since alpha&apos;s offspring are likely to be high quality, and since they perpetuate the female&apos;s genes, she instinctively seeks alpha as a mate. (Autocrats and European politicians encourage this behavior; US leaders elected by hypocritical Puritans often live to regret it.) If researchers (or the market) provide a primate band with tokens which can be exchanged for valuables like food, alpha will steal them from subordinates and hoard them. Witness the &lsquo;bank bailout&rsquo; of 2008.
</p>

<p>The triad of sex, bullying, and token-theft seems to complete the repertoire of the alpha male. It is not a pretty picture, but Rolex watches and Ferraris are widely held to improve the image. We should not let such subsidiary perquisites disguise the primary purpose of alpha-maledom. Moulay the Bloodthirsty sired 888 children; Chinghis Khan apparently has <a class="fn">16 million descendants<span>

	N Jonason, P Li, GD Webster, DP Schmitt (2009) &lsquo;The Dark Triad: Facilitating a Short-Term Mating Strategy in Men&rsquo; <cite>Eur. J. Personality</cite> <b>23</b>: 5&ndash;18; doi: 10.1002/per.698.

	In the undergraduate section of his CV, one of the co-authors &mdash; a recently minted PhD &mdash; listed 6 occasions when he was &lsquo;Awarded $1000 for research with undergraduate ___&rsquo;, where the blank was filled with a girl&apos;s name (one of which was Jennifer Lopez).<br>
	I bow to a master grantsman!
</span></a>	Most of these qualities are expressions of alpha&apos;s complete self-centeredness, while thrill-seeking is advertizement signifying &lsquo;I have such good genes that I can afford to take risks&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>There is nothing new in the idea that alpha&apos;s behavior is the root of all evil. Philosophers from Diogenes the Cynic to Hobbes and <a class="fn">HJ Morgenthau<span>
	HJ Morgenthau (1948/1958) <cite>Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace</cite>. (Knopf, NYC).
</span></a> &mdash; the Grand Old Man of modern political Realism &mdash; have seen the &lsquo;ubiquity of evil in human action&rsquo; arising from the lust for power &mdash; which is what Instinct-1 and the alpha male are all about. The bottom line is a simple <a class="fn">paradox:<span>
	Even Mohammed knew this (at least about other people). In what is presumably a hadith (although I cannot find it in available collections) he told a subordinate who asked to be given command of a captured territory that the request itself proved him unsuited for the job.
<br>
	Remember Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, the Roman farmer who interrupted sowing his crop, accepted the dictatorship, did the job that needed doing (a specific politico-military action) in 16 days, resigned the dictatorship, and went back to farming. (Wars were shorter when politicians did not profit financially from them!)

<p>It is easy to get confused about instincts: <a class="fn">One investigator<span>
	LL Bernard (1924) <cite>Instinct: A Study in Social Psychology</cite> (Allen &amp; Unwin, London).
</span></a>	thought we had thousands; others argue that humans have none, because there is no basic drive that cannot be overruled by the human will. <a class="fn">One  philosopher<span>

</span></a>	described instincts &lsquo;as charmingly old-fashioned theoretical constructs&rsquo; &mdash; but I think he has never been truly thirsty.
</p>

<p>There appear to be instincts in each of the brain&apos;s 3 layers. In the reptilian brain are neural structures controlling the basic processes that keep us alive without attention. Turn off the rest of the brain in a coma, and the brainstem will maintain us vegetatively for years. The limbos has the basic quartet of fear, rage, hunger, and lust. What distinguishes us from other animals is that our cortex can control these to some extent &mdash; although the opposite response of letting our limbos control our cortex is more common. We are clever at finding reasons for doing what our limbos wants. &lsquo;All&apos;s fair in love and war&rsquo; justifies duplicitous means to a limbic end. Experience suggests that this is a poor strategy, leading to accusations of &lsquo;betrayal&rsquo; or &lsquo;war crimes&rsquo;. Because the limbos cannot plan ahead, it insists that such rationalizations are good tactics. We have a built-in conflict of interests in our multi-layer brains.
</p>

<p>What we might call &lsquo;cortical instincts&rsquo; form the psychological trio of Table 11.1, which introduces ideas that we will pursue in subsequent chapters. It suggests that pothodoxy itself has gained instinctive rank. The timing is complicated. Instinct-1 is primordial and preverbal. Instinct-2 predates language, but its human expansion into deliberate action required the ability to tell stories. The viability increase brought about by this venture then entrained a third instinct, the mammals&rsquo; copycat ability to learn from parental example, transmuting it into the belief in parental stories that I have called pothodoxy. Cooperation between pothodoxy and Instinct-2 was purely beneficial during the Upper Paleolithic. Not until the Neolithic did Instinct-1 subvert pothodoxy to its own ends, but it is still very much with us.
</p>

<p>The interpolated rows for the combination of instincts formalize processes we will describe in detail below. <a class="fn">Schleiermacher<span>
	FDE Schleiermacher (1799) <cite>On Religion: Speeches to it&apos;s Cultured Despisers</cite>, trans. J Oman (K Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., London, 1893).
</span></a>	described what he called a &lsquo;universal instinct for religion&rsquo;, given to us by god to lead us back to him. We will come to understand its formation in somewhat different terms in Ch. 13. The manner in which this combination was co-opted by Instinct-1 is taken up in Chs. 14 &amp; 15. Alpha&apos;s Instinct-1 is deeply engraved in the genes of social animals &mdash; yet some people manage to minimize its influence. Pothodoxy is a disbenefit by itself, which may have no animal <a class="fn">analog.<span>
	Konrad Lorenz described a water shrew with a related problem. An assistant moved a rock in the shrew&apos;s cage. The shrew trotted along his known path, jumped onto the (missing) rock, landed hard, went home &mdash; and repeated the process several times, before deciding that something had changed and switching to mapping mode. The shrew&apos;s excuse is that he has the smallest brain among mammals; fundamentalists must take refuge in something like minimal ability to form new synapses.
<br>-----------------<br>
	K Lorenz (1949) <cite>King Solomon&apos;s Ring</cite> (Routledge, NY, 1952).
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Instinct-1&apos;s co-option of pothodoxy gave us fundamentalism, with the disadvantages of both its parents. The late and civilizing Instinct-2 probably rode piggyback on a common animal system (see <a href="#08">Sibling Justice</a> below), extending it for its own ends. When there was but a single religion, Schleiermacher&apos;s &lsquo;religious instinct&rsquo; combined pothodoxy with Instinct-2 to generate a combination that was useful (which is why are still encumbered with pothodoxy). When religions proliferate, Schleiermacher&apos;s combination often becomes a problem. While it is easy for the flexible agnostic to resolve the problem by dismissing pothodoxy, supernaturalists are not able do this, and this difference is so pronounced that it appears to be genetic.

<p>The evolutionary fact behind deliberate evil (and the perplexed concept of original sin) is Instinct-1. We all share it to some extent, we are all subject to its urges and influence, and it is the major drive behind crime and the problems of civilization &mdash; wars, rape, murder, robbery (&lsquo;some will rob you with a 6-gun &mdash; and some with a fountain pen&rsquo;), inequality, injustice, brutality, malfeasance, greed, and all the other nastiness that we get into.

<p>At the beginning of the Miocene our ancestors were led by acquisitive, ruthless, self-centered, harem-keeping bullies. This was the behavior needed for success. The pattern is recognizable today, although we tend to call its human proponents &lsquo;dinosaurs&rsquo;. It may be that the behavior pattern goes back that far, but we have little social data for dinosaurs, and they were not among our ancestors. &lsquo;Baboons&rsquo; is a more realistic comparison. The behavioral suite of the alpha baboon has worked well for 15 million years. It is deeply embedded in the primate genome; as <a class="fn">Milton<span>
	J Milton (1667) <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> (James Kayk, Pittsburg PA, 1836): 3.130.

</p>

<p>Table 11.2 suggests examples of Instinct-1 behavior in the Paleolithic. However well it works for baboons and chimpanzees, and however much it is still venerated by socially challenged conservatives, it was not enough to get us out of the Middle Paleolithic. At 50 ka, Instinct-1 was still the master trait of humans. Today it kills unrelated family members (spouses, mothers-in-law) 11 times more often than those who share the <a class="fn">murderer&apos;s genes.<span>

<p>I have, fortunately, seldom observed this aspect of Instinct-1 in humans. However, Marmelade, as sweet-natured a ginger tomcat as you could ask for, one day identified a male kitten (possibly his own, from the coloration) as competition. Clearly not knowing what he was doing, he pushed the kitten down and buried his nose in its belly. I intervened at this point. The kitten rubbed happily against Marmelade and dashed off to chase a leaf. Marmelade stalked him, ears and head carriage indicating that it was not roughhouse play that he had in mind. The effect was horror itself; civilization had gone by the board, a dark and murderous atavism taking its place. Cats may not have much in the way of free will, but as any devotee of <cite>Old Possum&apos;s Book of Practical Cats</cite> knows, their personalities may be as strong and distinct as those of furless people. Marmelade did not <i>intend</i> to kill the kitten, else he would have savaged it at his first opportunity. He was operating under step-by-step instinct, an automaton bent on &mdash; not murder, not even cat-slaughter, but &mdash; &lsquo;Remove Competition&rsquo;. We see the same blinkered, automatic behavior in step-fathers quieting annoying noises, burocrats following orders, and corporate raiders dismantling local <a class="fn">employers.<span>
	Marmelade went to the vet to have his testosterone level permanently reduced. (I&apos;ll hazard a guess that this would work on baby-batterers and corporate raiders also.) The kitten survived, forever known by Marmelade&apos;s dictum, &lsquo;You&apos;re <i><q>Toast</q></i>!&rsquo;. They eventually became friends.

<p>The human aspiration for equality and justice has it roots in sibling rivalry. Children with older siblings are constantly on guard lest they lose in the division of spoils. The urge is <i>not</i> &lsquo;Let&apos;s share this equally&rsquo;, but Instinct-1&apos;s &lsquo;I want it all!&rsquo;, battered down to &lsquo;No one gets more than I do!&rsquo; by competition with equals. Out of this wholly selfish urge, clever children invented the eminently equitable &lsquo;<a class="fn">You divide, I choose&rsquo;<span>
	This obvious choice for division into halves works for uniform objects, and it works for thirds if the 2nd participant trims the pieces and the 3rd chooses. This approach can be extended to any number of players, but fails in the absence of good faith (e.g., Mandate Palestine).
</span></a> ploy. Resentment of inequality seems to be a function of the <a class="fn">ventromedial prefrontal cortex,<span>
	E Tricomi &amp;3a (2010) &lsquo;Neural evidence for inequality-averse social preferences&rsquo; <cite>Nature</cite> <b>463</b>: 1089-1091; doi:10.1038/nature08785/
</span></a> which is happy to see others rewarded and shows indignation even when it is someone else who gets shafted. (At least this is true of individuals who are have not been indoctrinated with a sense of their own intrinsic superiority during childhood &mdash; a psychological variable which the experiment did not consider).
</p>

<p>Like many steps beyond raw selfishness, this extends what we think of as &lsquo;civilized behavior&rsquo; to close kin. The number of shared genes between relatives tells us how well they treat eachother. This is the concept of &lsquo;inclusive fitness&rsquo;: it is not <i>we</i> (individuals) who are selfish and greedy, but our <i>genes</i>. Alleles have no way of recognizing their copies in another individual, but relatives share alleles in direct correspondence to genetic probabilities. Our genes figured this out long before we did.
</p>

<p>The intelligent members of a human group usually reach the idea of mutual aid: &lsquo;The best way for <i>me</i> to get more is to help <i>everyone</i> get more.&rsquo; This democratic ideal of equal sharing comes from the same root as Alpha&apos;s urge to have it all, so in this sense we would not need to posit a new instinct to support egalitarianism. The best of intentions, however, fail before Alpha&apos;s <i>force majeur</i>, and there is no reason for any thought of sharing to extend beyond the immediate family. Here biological evolution falters, and cultural evolution comes into its own. As cultural evolutionists <a class="fn">Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd<span>

		alt="New idea" /></a>
rid of, so sterilization of the greedy would work as well today.
</p>

<p>Natural selection took care of part of the problem. Small human groups which were mutually supportive raised more children than groups where selfishness reigned. Instinct-2 was increasing group viability long before the days of rational thought. The birth of civilization apparently requires a critical balance between extremes that fail to produce it. On the one hand, an over-abundant economy puts no pressure on groups to thin out selfishness alleles. On the other, persistent scarcity leads to a harsh dog-eat-dog economy in which <a class="fn">armoring<span>

<p>This analysis suggests that moving into an unexploited ecotope with a small population provides a
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im"

window of opportunity for social advance during the ensuing population growth. Sooner or later, per-capita resources will begin to decrease, forcing a change of behavior &mdash; but the <i>direction</i> of change is not a foregone conclusion. Clearly, we have not always taken advantage of such moments, and I am not historian enough to test this hypothesis, but I find it intriguing.

	This is a recent (and reluctant) process. About 1970 the US government reviewed the weaponry that had resulted from recent grants for basic scientific research, and found that there was none. The Mansfield Amendment&apos;s (1973) logical response was that it was pointless to waste money on basic research, so it limited ARPA&apos;s (Advanced Research Project Agency) G$3.2 budget to strictly military projects. (It took scientists several years to respond that today&apos;s weaponry is founded on the basic research of 50 years ago.) Grant applications to NSF (the National Science Foundation) increased 4-fold (with no increase in the NSF budget). Fortunately, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) understands the problem, and devotes itself to diverting as much money as it can from battleship building (beloved by Congress) to funding research for weapons 50 years down the line. (I intentionally devoted my ONR-supported research to a problem which I thought entirely removed from killing people. The Navy found it applicable to minimizing the detectability of ships by sonar, and to an obscure problem of their nuclear reactors.)

<p>Why did chimps and bonobos, in the same environment, go different ways, while chimps and humans, in different environments, developed similar behavior? Our understanding of chimpanzee society is very recent, so we have to modify the question. Are we looking at convergent evolution &mdash; or have we forced new behavior on chimps by crowding?

Indeed, DNA competes with itself. Only the imperative survival of the organisms that carry the DNA keeps DNA itself disciplined. We see this whenever an extra copy of a chromosome creates a partially triploid individual: with rare exceptions, triploidy is lethal, and it always results in functional sterility. We see this with cancer: for metazoan DNA to survive, all but a tiny fraction of its DNA has to forgo replication. Let a single one of the trillions of somatic cells lose control, start replicating on it own, and if the immune system doesn&apos;t spot it and kill it, it will in turn kill its host. The close analogy between human populations and cancer is occasionally rediscovered by someone, <a class="fn">published<span>

<p>Machismo is instinctive and need not be learned. Altruistic counter behavior is very different, for Instinct-2 is weak, and its strength has fluctuated over time. In chimpanzees and gorillas Instinct-2 may be no stronger than in the Common Ancestor. Bonobos, the hippies among the apes, tried a different direction in which negotiations over recreational sex replace bullying. Appealing as this may be, it is not an <a class="fn">evolutionarily stable strategy<span>
	J Maynard Smith (1958) <cite>The Theory of Evolution</cite>. 3d ed. (Canto, Cambridge, 1975).
</span></a>	or ESS for bonobos, because they survive only where chimpanzees cannot get at them. In hippie compounds, and before them in the professed free love of bohemians, jealousy still raised its ugly head. Masculine DNA wants sole access to all females within reach; female DNA wants access to the alpha-est males in sight. Hence soap and other operas.
</p>

<p>Instinct-2 is less well characterized than machismo, and was overlooked by early evolutionists. This omission got a number of unfortunate programs off to bad careers, including the Social Darwinism of the 1860s, the totalitarianisms of the 1940s, the purblind MBAs since the 1950s, Regan/Thatcher neoconservatism, and Friedrich von Hayek&apos;s

</span></a> Social Darwinism may be functionally dead, but the others are still with us, thriving under the mistaken belief that they are supported by evolutionary logic. All that they demonstrate is that leaving the Middle Paleolithic behind was a difficult event that seems to have required exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<p>We can only guess at the expression of Instinct-2 in the Paleolithic. The most comprehensive description is that it is what finally got us out of the Middle Paleolithic. Table 11.3 considers some of the more obvious instances.

<p>Instinct-1 receives obvious hormonal reinforcement. A  latter-day example shows the benefit offered by this perhaps unfair advantage:
</p>

<blockquote>The first testicular guard, the &lsquo;Cup&rsquo;, was used in Hockey in 1874 and the first helmet was used in 1974. That means it only took 100 years for men to realize that their brain is also important. &mdash; Ken Sorbo on facebook.
</blockquote>

<p>Instinct-2 is apparently unsupported by hormonal physiology, so its manifestation is less emphatic than Instinct-1&apos;s. It requires the frontal-lobe processes of communication and cooperation, and so is about as far removed from the neural locus of classical instincts as possible. It is encouraged by learning and thinking. The feminine ending of the suggested vernacular name, <i>bonisma</i>, is in aid of promoting gender equality. The <i>bon</i>- root reminds us that Instinct-2 is a good thing &mdash; and indirectly recognizes the investigations of the bonobos in this direction. However it happened, what seems to have begun as a shift in the relative importance of contradictory instincts, became learned altruism and cultural transmission and gave us a way to move beyond machismo, setting us apart from nearly all other <a class="fn">animals.<span>
	&lsquo;Nearly&rsquo; is there because wolves and orcas are good at cultural transmission, and if we don&apos;t kill them off, may eventually develop their signals into language. Farley Mowat reported that Canadian Inuit can interpret wolf signals about caribou movements, and use this information in their own hunting.
</span></a></p>

<p>Note that Instinct-2 is not all sweetness and light. The indefatigable efforts of Samuel Bowles, Robert Boyd, Herbert Gintis, and Peter Richerson to create realistic models of small-scale societies lead inexorably to situations in which &lsquo;defectors&rsquo; &mdash; the greedy and aggressive &mdash; are punished. The problem is  that punishment is costly to the punisher (âYou can&apos;t fight City Hall&rsquo;; few Presidents have successfully taken on the banking system single-handedly; in a small group making enemies is not a good idea), and the devil is in the details. At the tribal level, ostracism for greed might mean losing a good hunter who felt that his contribution to the group should be better rewarded. At our level, it is apparently only during the revolutionary installation of a new form of government that we get political leaders who understand that &lsquo;the government&rsquo; is the natural opponent of &lsquo;the people&rsquo;. Any initial governmental interest in protecting the freedoms gained by the revolution quickly shifts to protecting the government from further revolution. Evasion of whatever checks and balances have been put in place receives the full, if usually covert, attention of later-generation politicians (recall Nixon&apos;s &lsquo;When the President does it, it isn&apos;t illegal&rsquo;, and George W. Bush&apos;s &lsquo;Stop throwing the Constitution in my face. It&apos;s just a god-damned piece of paper!&rsquo;) Whistle-blowers are seen as threats. Remember Bradley/Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, whistle-blowers extraordiniares, who did more for democracy than anyone since Patrick Henry. As of early October 2011, Manning &mdash; already incarcerated for nearly a year-and-a-half under conditions which 295 legal scholars and philosophers described as &lsquo;inhumane&rsquo; and approaching torture &mdash; topped the Guardian Poll nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. Snowden was <a class="fn">nominated in 2014.<span>
	Intended to commemorate those who advance &lsquo;fraternity between nations, reduction or abolition of standing armies, and the promotion of peace congresses&rsquo;, in their absence, the Peace Prize has often been awarded for social milestones, good ideas, sheer admiration, or blind hope.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>The <i>models</i> of small-scale societies (as I understand them) are gentle, considering &lsquo;naming and shaming&rsquo; to be effective punishment, and so do not resort to removal of individuals from the gene pool. When gentle measures fail in real life, small-scale societies often resort to quiet assassination. This removes the responsible alleles, and sends an unmistakable message to those who might still possess them. What works well in the <a class="fn">modelling world<span>
	R Boyd, H Gintis, S Bowles (2010) &lsquo;Coordinated Punishment of Defectors Sustains Cooperation and Can Proliferate When Rare&rsquo; <cite>Science </cite><b>328</b>: 617-620; DOI: 10.1126/science.1183665.</span></a> &mdash; an

ESS that cannot be invaded by less effective approaches &mdash; is <i>coordinated</i> punishment. In model groups of 72 people, coordination requires only a realistic level of genetic relatedness. This suggests that such methods worked well throughout the Paleolithic.
</p>

<p>However, when the population reaches 300 million, and relentless media manipulation has equated greed with &lsquo;the independent American spirit&rsquo;, the greedy are impossible to shame, they own the media that call them &lsquo;elites&rsquo;, and accept any publicity as recognition of their accomplishments. Coordinated punishment of the sort provided by legislation, whistle-blowers, and watchdog quangos &mdash; with an independent activist press whose editors can quote <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite> &mdash; might help, but it still needs to be backstopped with genetic death of alleles, whether by removal of individuals or gonads. When we neglect such precautions and end up with 2 dozen people owning most of the wealth, we have nobody but ourselves to blame.

<p>Instinct-2 should not be thought of as having arisen by magic. It is the latest expression of a long evolutionary trend. As noted above, the underlying conflict of biology is DNA<b> </b>replication. Among single-celled protists with a single chromosome, every strand of DNA is free to replicate on its own. It has no need to accommodate any other DNA in the universe. It is as self-centered as it is possible to be. The DNA of bacteria is a single continuous piece, without even a nuclear membrane to contain it. Squash a bacterium and its DNA spills out like one long looping spaghetto. As with us, everything else in the bacterium is there for one purpose only: to assist in the replication of the DNA.
</p>

<p>The problem arose when DNA accidentally discovered that it was advantageous to have more than a single cell involved in replication. Suddenly self-interest was no longer the only criterion of success. That this has been a difficult idea to come to terms with can be seen from contemporary corporation law, which is still governed by the &lsquo;single-cell&rsquo; philosophy. Even though we ourselves are cooperative entities of 60&ndash;100 trillion individual cells, we still think of ourselves in self-centered terms, we still prefer to compete rather than cooperate with other individuals. This is a bit of an anachronism. If our genes haven&apos;t learned the value of cooperation, our brains (which can learn in 35 minutes what genes learn in 35 generations &mdash; a 10-million-fold acceleration) should have learned it in primary school.

<p>Kinship altruism is first seen in organisms which are in the borderland between protoctists and metazoa. In <i>Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii</i>, a single-celled green alga, a gene called <i>regA</i> is switched on under difficult conditions. It prevents the cell from growing and dividing, allowing it to use all of its resources for survival. It was not long before <i>Volvox carteri</i> discovered that it could live as a <a class="fn">colonial alga<span>

</p>

<p>Colonial insects, naked mole rats, and alpha males carry this division of labor to extremes, with a single reproductive individual surrounded by a non-reproductive society. It may be difficult to see these cases as &lsquo;altruism&rsquo;, since the benefit is not freely offered. Nevertheless, the reproductive benefit to the species is larger than the loss to individuals, and the genes involved profit from this.

<p>A new kinship altruism appeared early in the Archaic Ãgean world. Its military aspect is epitomized by Gorgidas&apos;s organization of pair-bonded homosexuals into the Theban Sacred Band in 378 BCE. They became the most effective defensive unit of their day (twice defeating the otherwise all-conquering Spartans). They were invincible until 338, when as 40-year veterans, all 300 died at Chaeronea, facing the superior numbers of Philip of Macedon, who praised their bravery. We might think of them as the Bronze Age Pink Berets. Recall Achilles&apos;s reaction to the death of Patroklos to understand why this band was so effective, and how culture-bound is contemporary homophobia.

<p>These examples are intraspecific kinship surrogates, but there are broader manifestations as well. Domestic animals that would not stand a chance in the wild thrive in association with humans by pseudokinship. Dogs and cats take membership in their human families for granted; lions, wolves, otters, cheetahs, seals, baboons, chimpanzees, elephants, and probably other species offer family membership to people who are harmless and around enough to become <i>familiar</i>, although this may take years of interaction. The mammalian response to kinship surrogates is unconscious, irrational, and strong enough to transcend species boundaries.

<p>Instinct-2 accounts for everything beneficial that religion has produced. Unfortunately, to achieve these desirable ends, it used trickery and deceit. Just as Instinct-2 arose out of sibling rivalry, it hijacked a pre-existing trust in parental instruction to ensure its own transmission. This is why priests and kings want us to call them &lsquo;father&rsquo; and &lsquo;sire&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Eric Hoffer&apos;s <cite>The True Believer</cite> treated this troublesome aspect of religion, which tags certain topics as &lsquo;religious&rsquo;, accepts them as factual, and blocks the prefrontal cortex from considering them. If this idea has been followed up, I haven&apos;t found it, so it looks to me like
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im"
		src="../Images/K-Research3.gif"
		alt="../Images/K-Research3.gif" /></a>
sadly neglected research. Given the absence of any further work, all I can suggest is a suspicion that the procedure which allowed this hijacking and created the ritual link between kinship and religion was the tribal Coming of Age ceremony, when one was introduced to the mythos of the tribe.
</p>

</h4>

<p>The Coming of Age ceremony marked the transition to adulthood. In the Paleolithic the transition was sharper than it is today, for life was often over before the brain matured. Coming of age includes three components, symbolized in Fig. 11.2.
</p>

<p>The first component is sexual maturity. Universally recognizable, this needs no comment, except that its obviousness may conceal the other components.
</p>

The &lsquo;full brain&rsquo; mode might have begun in the 20s prehistorically, but wiring is finished near 30 today. Sexual maturity, cessation of learning, and religious initiation are simultaneous in prehistory, but widely distributed later.">

Coming of Age, then and now. Events once part of a single process are now often separated in time.
</figcaption> </figure>


<p>The second component is mental: the mammalian brain has 2 functional modes, switching from flexible learning to fast response when an offspring becomes independent. It appears in the refusal of some animals to eat foods not introduced by their mothers. A human manifestation is the urge of many teenagers to get out of school and on with life. An example may not be out of place. At age 14, a New England neighbor was pleased to have a tame college professor to respond to his normal curiosity. By 15, he was evading any challenge to think, referring me to his fundamentalist father for True Answers. By 16, having learned everything he needed to know, he dropped out of school to take a job on a fishing smack, throwing rocks overboard and clams into the hold (for which he was paid more than the state paid an assistant professor). The mechanism of this change remains in doubt, although modulation <a class="fn">calcium influx<span>
	JZ Tsien (2000) Letter, <cite>Scientific American</cite> <b>283</b>(#2): 6.
</span></a>	through the NMDA receptor has been suggested.
</p>

<p>The third component was initiation into tribal mysteries, including a formalization of the duties made incumbent by Instinct-2. Its remnant today is a heightened susceptibility to religion, sometimes institutionalized as the sacrament of confirmation. <a class="fn">Konrad Lorenz<span>
	K Lorenz (????) <cite></cite> (): 60 ff, but which book? (Not <cite>On Aggression</cite>.)
</span></a>	describes this peri-pubertal period as the time when people are most easily indoctrinated, making it the preferred age for cultic recruiting.
</p>

<p>These events were once simultaneous, as in the top line of Fig. 11.2 Our only defense against large predators and worsening climate was the social structure of the tribe. Coming of Age combined readiness to breed with the completion of childhood learning, acceptance of adult responsibilities, and initiation into the spiritual mysteries that bound the tribe into a working unit. It marked the moment one started repaying the social debt accumulated during childhood. To encourage the shift from dependency to contribution &mdash; a step that is still difficult &mdash; I suggest that at this time, a specific biochemical process induced emotional bonding to the tribe as a conceptual (spiritual) entity <i>and its accompanying belief system</i>. The neurological process has not been studied, but
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im"
		src="../Images/K-Research3.gif"
		alt="../Images/K-Research3.gif" /></a>
would be as involuntary as falling in love. Just when the bonds of the nuclear family were dissolving, bonding to the surrogate family of tribe-and-coreligionists was powerfully enhanced. According to Fig. 11.2, this gave us 15&ndash;20 years to live with True Belief in the tribal story.
</p>

<p>The persistence of True Belief today, when there is no advantage to it, suggests that the cortical block that prevents analytic thinking might be instinctive &mdash; that is, hard wired under genetic control. For this to happen, there must have been strong negative selection against those who did not possess it. This is only half the story, however, and pothodoxy is the other half. Persistence in the <i>wrong</i> belief could get you killed in many historic periods: Muhamad and Charlemagne both considered conversion by the sword a legitimate process, as did Hitler, Stalin, Mao, <a class="fn">Pol Pot,<span>
	 Pol Pot&apos;s elimination of &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo; (ie, anyone who wore glasses, an indication that he could read) was probably irrelevant to religion, being merely a precaution to simplify authoritarian control.
</span></a> and any number of lesser dictators. Recall <a href="../_B/B06.shtml#29">Repopulating Heaven</a>. There were many like him along the river valleys of the ancient civilizations: For the Ganges, the <cite>Arthasastra</cite> (&lsquo;The statecraft of material gain&rsquo;) of Kautalya ca 400 BCE, is as singlemindedly amoral as any CIA manual of corruption, espionage, and regime change. In lineages subjected to such selection, the alogical ability to <i>maintain</i> belief while changing the <i>details</i> of belief was at a premium, for it saved your life. The prototypical pothodox survivalist is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vicar_of_Bray_%28song%29"><cite>Vicar of Bray</cite>.</a>
</p>

<p>The wide geographical dispersion of the philosophers of the Axial Age might argue against a universal negative instinct. Yet the same inbred group that produced Isaiah still sports an Orthodox subset that writes (and follows) pursuers&rsquo; decrees, so there is still work to be done in sorting out the thorny question of genetics vs environment.
</p>

<p>What one might suspect from a distribution like this is genetic control. This could be a major allele promoting pothodoxy and a rare recessive allele inducing prefrontal connections, or a &lsquo;balanced polymorphism&rsquo; like <a href="../_E/E18.shtml#F18.1">Fig. 18.1</a>. Depending upon earlier episodes of selection,
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im"
		src="../Images/K-Research3.gif"
		alt="../Images/K-Research3.gif" /></a>
one expects different allele frequencies in different populations. Where Jihad and Inquisition were most effective, the recessive allele will be selected against and rare, but it cannot be extirpated. Where variety and eccentrics were tolerated, the &lsquo;development&rsquo; allele can spread more easily. Perhaps one might explain the distribution of Enlightenment thinkers in this manner: predominantly German, Dutch, English, Scottish, and French &mdash; does this reflect a historical and regional lack of negative selection for cortical thinking? The question requires a major historico-genetic exploration; in the meantime, it will do as a working hypothesis.
</p>

<p>The &lsquo;rewiring&rsquo; time shown in <a href="#F11.2">Fig. 11.2</a> is today&apos;s, but the process is little understood. It might not have occurred at all, or at the same time, or in the same manner, during prehistory, and its relation to the disintegration of the coming-of-age period, and particularly, the extension of the learning period, is unknown. What we see as &lsquo;play&rsquo; in kittens and other young animals is exploration during the learning mode. It may indeed be fun and accompanied by loud purring, but it is also an imperative instinctive need. I have been importuned by kittens who lacked mothers or siblings: &lsquo;<i>Play</i> with me! It&apos;s <i>important</i>!&rsquo;. I have been pestered by a fledgling California scrub jay (<i>Aphelocoma californica</i>, &lsquo;the only non-primate shown to plan ahead&rsquo;) who felt that it was time to learn to fly, and he made it clear that as his &lsquo;parent&rsquo;, there was something I was supposed to show him at this point in <a class="fn">his life.<span>
	As it happened, we <i>were</i> flying at the time &mdash; on a commercial flight. I was not able to explain this to him, and whatever it was that he expected of me, I failed to provide. He learned on his own, starting with 45Â° flights from my shoulder to the ground. He later went through a 10-day period of bringing me food: I would wake up to find a breakfast collation of 6 or 8 dead flies waiting by my pillow. Apparently scrub jays are among those in which the first brood stays around to help the parents feed a second batch.
</span></a> The &lsquo;Intellectuals&rsquo; bar of Fig. 11.2, with life-long learning indicated, may be a way of saying that scientists and writers and artists and such are simply people who never outgrew the childhood need to learn. Remember the playful photo of Einstein sticking his tongue out. Recall Chaser&apos;s wish to <a href="../_C/C09.shtml#03a">continue learning</a>: perhaps Border Collies, like many contemporary humans, have bypassed the &lsquo;switch&rsquo; and are doomed to lifelong learning.
