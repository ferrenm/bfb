<p>The top of Fig. 10.1 is at 1 Ma, in the Middle Paleolithic of <i>H. erectus</i>. The status quo was Instinct-1, which established the principal hominid method of removing genetic defects: All female alleles are represented in succeeding generations, but not all male alleles. In the Neolithic, Instinct-1 becomes an important negative aspect of religion, but in the early days it was a mixed blessing. It gave us the planet, but it is incompatible with civilization, and it knew nothing about religion. If the people who arrived in Europe had had religion, it seems unlikely that New Guinea could have avoided it. This suggests 40 ka as the <i>terminus post quem</i> for the invention of religion.
</p>

<p>The <i>terminus ante quem</i> is poorly constrained, but the Paleolithic figurines are abundant by 20 ka, suggesting that religion was underway earlier. This gives us ~25&ndash;40 ka for the Urzeit, which is a sufficient period for pothodoxy to work its way into our DNA. This range is bracketed as the &lsquo;critical period&rsquo; in Fig. 10.1, at the beginning of the Ice Age when the Eurasian population was <a class="fn">below 10,000.<span>
	Genetic modification is easier, the smaller the affected group. Altering allele ratios in larger groups requires both a consensus and a conscious program of punishing nonconformists.

<a href="#TOC"> The Paleolithic Transition </a>
<a class="tri" href="#02">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>This critical period was (I found) also the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition. It has been described as &lsquo;The Great Leap Forward&rsquo; by Jared Diamond, as a &lsquo;creative explosion&rsquo; by John Pfeiffer, as the result of a mysterious black monolith by <a class="fn">Arthur C. Clarke<span>
	This entry is poetic license. Clarke actually placed the influence of the monolith some 6 million years earlier. Its major effect in the film version of 2001 was to inspire an ancestor to tool use, clubbing a member of another band to death with a heavy femur. Given that we now know that chimpanzees use spears, this seems like an invention that did not require extra-terrestrial assistance. Or perhaps teaching weapons use was the monolith&apos;s sole accomplishment. The M/U-P transition is much sharper and more impressive.
</span></a> &mdash; and most accessibly, as Jean Auel&apos;s heroine &lsquo;Ayla&rsquo;, in the <i>Earth&apos;s Children</i> books, where she singlehandedly introduces most of the features of the Paleolithic Transition. The Transition is usually seen as an improvement in technique, including new stone tool forms, sewing, long-distance exchange of raw materials, and the use of bone, antler, ivory and <a class="fn">rare minerals<span>
	E.g., naturally occurring marcasite (octahedral FeS) for fire-starting. It makes bigger sparks than pyrite (cubic FeS), the familiar &lsquo;fool&apos;s gold&rsquo;.
</span></a> for the production of domestic and ritual <a class="fn">objects.<span>
	O Bar-Yosef (2007) &lsquo;The Archaeological Framework of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution&rsquo; <cite>Diogenes</cite> <b>54</b>(#2): 3&ndash;18.
</span></a> At first, such &lsquo;modern behavior&rsquo; was assumed to correspond with the appearance of anatomically modern humans (AMH).
</p>

<p>Then it turned out that AMH were present in Africa 100,000 years earlier, without modern behavior. The most astonishing advance in the history of human culture was <a class="fn">orphaned of a cause.<span>
	J Shreve (1995) <cite>The Neandertal Enigma: solving the mystery of modern human origins</cite> (William Morrow, NYC).
</span></a> Paleontologists looked for changes in brain convolutions in skulls, but in vain. <a class="fn">Some<span>
	S Oppenheim (2004) <cite>Out of Eden</cite> (Robinson, London): 123.
</span></a> suggested that there was no &lsquo;leap&rsquo;, because a dozen-odd developments characteristic of Behaviorally Modern Humans (BMH) were in sporadic use long before we left Africa, as at <a class="fn">Blombos Cave<span>
	&bull; CS Henshilwood &amp;10a (2002) &lsquo;Emergence of Modern Human Behaviour: Middle Stone Age engravings from South Africa&rsquo; <cite>Science</cite> <b>295</b>: 1278&ndash;1280.<br>

</span></a> in South Africa.
</p>

<p>If the immediate cause of the Transition was neither the speciation of AMH, nor an identifiable modification of the brain, we are left with a change in neural wiring, or, perhaps, nothing more tangible than an idea. However, despite its results, this idea could not have been esoteric, or a philosophical call to higher ethics. It had to have been something down-to-earth that would resonate strongly with the limbic urges of talking, food-cooking chimpanzees, which is about all we can claim to have been as we left Africa.
</p>

<p>Resolving this dilemma will take us on a long journey, 4 of whose major events are indicated in the upper white area of Fig. 10.1: Toba, Out of Africa (OOA), Arrival in New Guinea, and Arrival in Europe.

Most ash was carried northwest by the summer monsoon,
with 9 m deposited in western Malaysia, 6 m in eastern and 3 m in western India, and lesser amounts in the Middle East and northeast Africa.

<p>While Fig 10.5 shows Toba ash minimally falling on the Horn of Africa, its climatic effects were world wide, producing 6 years of &lsquo;nuclear winter&rsquo;, triggering or intensifying the cold spell of Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 (Fig. 10.2) &mdash; the largest drop to the coldest temperature in the last 110,000 years, with world wide effects for 10,000 years.

<p>The best places for African AMH to survive would have been south of the equator, and perhaps northwest Africa. As Fig. 10.2 shows, 65 ka was a glacial maximum, with a pluvial in North Africa and grass and game in the Sahara, so we can expect to find humans there. Forest chimpanzees west of the Rift mountains were hard hit, but weathered Toba better than in the east, where like us, the chimpanzees lost genetic diversity.

Paleolithic temperature. The light spiky curve is an isotopic temperature <a class="fn">proxy<span>
	There is no short, easy way to explain oxygen isotopes as a proxy for temperature. The number of confounding chemical, physical, and geographical processes that affect isotope distribution is impressive. The basic aspect is that light molecules move faster than heavy ones, and the difference is smaller, the higher the temperature. Water vapor has less <sup>18</sup>O (heavy oxygen) than the water it evaporated from. Heavy molecules condense before light, so rainfall as an airmass travels removes <sup>18</sup>O. At a given site, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the δ<sup>18</sup>O reflects the air temperature at condensation altitude (cloud base). See Wikipedia and the web for more information.

</span></a> The black descent in OIS-4 might have been triggered by Toba&apos;s volcanic winter, leaving the starred * peak as an indication of how little we understand climate. The Glacial Maximum at 63 ka means grass in the Horn of Africa and a good time to leave Africa &mdash; or be driven out by competitors. The decrease of high-frequencies (sharp spikes) with age is an artefact of molecular diffusion, ice flow, and water percolation. Even the best ice crystals have mobile water molecules on the surface.

<p>The mismatch between the curve and the labels across the bottom of Fig. 10.2 reveals an interpretive problem: The isotope curve records the air temperature above the Greenland plateau, rather than the European climate, which is epitomized by the labels and is subject to additional influences. LGM is Last Glacial Maximum, of major importance in Europe.

<p>The human race has less genetic diversity than a band of 50 bonobos <a href="C11.shtml#F11.1">(Fig. 11.1),</a> but far more phenotypic (racial) diversity. For any given genetic locus, 15% of the total variation is between groups, phenotypically (racially) visible, and 85% is within group.

	RC Lewontin (1972) &lsquo;The apportionment of human diversity&rsquo; <cite>Evolutionary Biol</cite> <b>6</b>: 381&ndash;398.

</span></a> because it fails when more loci are examined. Had Lewontin been correct, the popular haplogroups (which classify variation <i>below</i> the level of race) would not be detectable. Classification can be done to any level desired, from phylum to individual, depending upon the number of loci used. (Because response to both pathogens and biochemicals shows considerable correlation with race, and sometimes with haplogroup, this can be important medically.) Natural selection continues to operate on the differences at all levels.

	Too much UV destroys essential folate; too little limits essential vitamin D. Natural selection adjusts skin color (controlled by the alleles of half-a-dozen genes) to latitudinal UV levels in 30 generations (600 years) unless sexual selection for preferred shade intervenes.
</span></a> The bottleneck model explains racial difference by loss of alleles, which is the fast and easy way of creating genetic difference. It does not take into account the numerous new alleles carried by each individual, resulting from errors in copying DNA. Many of these will be silent; others will produce an instantly fatal difference that is immediately weeded out. Occasionally one will produce an improvement that causes no problems elsewhere. A good case can be made that it was one (or more) of the latter that enabled us to emerge from the 160,000-year rut of the Middle Paleolithic.

<p>Despite the success of the Out of Africa hypothesis, there has been just enough gene flow to confuse the issue with the competing Multiregional hypothesis, which holds that that humans arose two million years ago and subsequently evolved as a single intercontinental interbreeding species.

</span></a> that left Africa may not have set out to conquer the world, but merely to escape more aggressive neighbors. Perhaps, less successful at whatever the expansionist group had perfected, they specialized in near-shore fishing, if not with boats, perhaps using logs with primitive outriggers. (Such fishing has the advantage of offering a constant, familiar, and otherwise unexploited ecotope that coincides exactly with the route of Fig 10.5. Given the dearth of fresh water along the route, one suspects that they knew how to obtain a low-salt drink by squeezing fish.)

An interesting possibility is that the departing tribe might have had an important advantage over inland populations. Fish and shellfish are among the best sources of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. <a class="fn">Experiments<span>

</span></a> have shown that supplementing the diet of modern formula-fed newborns with these materials improved &lsquo;memory, problem solving, discrimination, classification, language, and social skills&rsquo; when tested later. Seafood-fed mothers would provide these building blocks of the brain to their babies, for perhaps a 5-point IQ increase. In short, the mean IQ of the departing tribe might already have been 65.
</p>

<p>As was true until 1500 CE, there were 10 to 30 times as many fish in the ocean as there are <a class="fn">today<span>
	Since sunlight and nutrients have not changed, this may seem odd. The difference in biomass is like that between forest and grassland. Salps &mdash; little tubes that eat by swimming &mdash; replace commercial fish; net size selects for genetic dwarfs in surviving fish populations.

	Example: 2 rocky coastal sites, 500 m apart, but one accessible to urban day sailors and the other not. The first was devoid of life; at the other I sat in one spot and patted 40 meal-sized shellfish. 30 years later, the literature described this as &lsquo;encounter rates for high-ranked inter-tidal molluscs may fall sharply under sustained collecting pressure&rsquo;.

</span></a> By the time they reached southeast Asia, they were comfortable crossing water to any land they could see. Sea-level rise, washing out the exodus route, has made it difficult to think of a way to falsify this IQ advantage, so it is perforce a conjecture, but it makes a good story, well supported by genetics.

<p>While drawing Fig. 10.5, I &lsquo;walked&rsquo; the strandloper route in Google Earth. From Djibouti in Africa to Dubai there is nothing to lure one inland. Across the Strait of Hormuz, there is no visible difference between left (up the Persian Gulf, into the Middle East) or right, on to Karachi on the Indus. Here the delta might divide the group into <i>conservatives</i> (continue along the beach, a choice needing nothing beyond the familiar surf-fishing) and <i>explorers</i> (up the Indus, into a new and diverse environment, requiring skills not needed since Africa). Once inland, the Indus&ndash;Ganges offer a continuous riparian environment. The routes over the Khyber Pass, or along the Brahamaputra and into the <a href="../_C/C12.shtml#04" class="fk">hills

A correlation which does not seem to have been commented on is that connecting the dots in order (from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Horn) generates a path which is very similar to the migration routes deduced from genetics, with the proviso that one path is linear and the other branched. (Dot-connecting obscures branch points, and traverses some segments in the wrong direction, but is otherwise accurate.) I find this an astonishing and unexpected confirmation of &lsquo;the route&rsquo; of Fig. 10.5 and the more complex versions on the web, considering the difficulties involved in collecting, integrating, and interpreting ethnological data. There is also the surprising feature that cultural similarities have survived the 10,000&ndash;50,000 year interval since they left their neighbors behind. Such cultural inertia makes the &lsquo;Critical Moment&rsquo; all the more extraordinary, and emphasizes the fact that not everyone shared in it.

<p>What were the African emigrants like? Who most resembles them today? To answer this question, we need to reconstruct a &lsquo;Common Ancestral Beachcomber&rsquo;. I tried to make a start on this, with a table of a dozen candidates, but it soon became obvious that this was premature. The candidates begin with the Biaka (West Pygmies) of South Africa and extend as far as the Tierra del Fuegans, with an incomplete listing of <a class="fn" href="http://www.andamans.org">53 cultures,<span>
	The reference to this list was the incomplete &lsquo;George Weber (2007)&rsquo; when I first noted it. In August of 2013, all web searches for anything related to Weber&apos;s masterwork <cite>The Andamanese</cite> led to an unscrupulous Japanese company which had bought the domain while he was ill and not paying attention, essentially destroying 16 years of irreplaceable research. [Purchase of domain names is controlled by domain registrars, but it seems that while they make money off the names, they are not required to act responsibly. I would suggest that notifying people of incipient sales, and backing up resold sites for a decade, should be required functions of domain registrars.] Concerned anthropologists are attempting to rebuild Weber&apos;s site (from the Wayback Machine and other resources, but as of mid 2016 there is a long way to go, and none of the specifically Andamanese research has been recovered).
</span></a> and mention of other little-known tribes in the mountainous interior of Indonesian islands. This suggests that a definitive description of the common out-of-Africa ancestor requires more than a literature search, including further field work and some

	A musical style in which two voices move so that one is constant while the other moves and vice-versa. This is, I think, what Melanesians do, and the effect is notable. Terrence Malick&apos;s 1999 movie adaptation of James Jones&apos;s <i>The Thin Red Line</i> is perhaps the most accessible example, with an Academy Award nomination for best sound {UPC 09026-63470-2}.

</span></a> suggesting a deep connection.
</p>

<p>Many of these candidates are vertically challenged (&lsquo;pigmy&rsquo; now being deemed pejorative). This seems to be more an adaptive trait than an indication of relatedness, and is accompanied by a shortening of development time and lifespan. None of the candidate groups (by definition) participated in the &lsquo;<a class="fn">Great Leap&rsquo;.<span>
	Incidentally, John Grisham has a vignette which concisely describes behavior among present-day Melanesian descendants of the 60-ka exodus who did not experience the events of 35 ka in Western Eurasia. With keen insight and a novelist&apos;s freedom, he provides what I suspect is a realistic example of Middle Paleolithic life.

	This was probably a red herring.

[And they survived where the clever advanced white men died!]
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">This description may support the suggestion that we did not leave Africa voluntarily, but as an act of desperation, escaping groups more adept at exploiting inland resources.
</p>

<p>In any case, as more of the genome is studied, the possibility of reconstructing a Common Emigrant will increase. There is some urgency, as most candidate tribes are dwindling. In the meantime, an observation that might simplify matters is that there was constant selection for conservatism in the strandlopers. Every time there was an option to explore a river system, it was the adventurous novelty-seeking group who went inland. The conservatives preferred to stay with their tried and true lifestyle. This suggests that those who travelled farthest are those who most resemble the starting group (despite modifications en route). My description of the &lsquo;Common Emigrant&rsquo; therefore starts by including the common features of Tasmanians and Tierra del Fuegians, plus whatever Melanesians and the relicts of Fig. 10.5 offer in common. We had not travelled far before the European haplogroups wandered off up the Persian Gulf and Indus.

<p>Grandmothers were long thought to be unique to <i>H. sapiens</i>. For most species, fertility and life expectancy are roughly equal. The advantage of early parenthood in a long-lived species is that damage to germ-cell DNA increases with time (e.g., Down&apos;s Syndrome in children of older mothers), so there is good reason for menopause. With major brain wiring incomplete until age 30, and repair systems that work for 2 or 3 times that long, there is also good <a class="fn">reason<span>

<p>When a 30-year drought dries all of the waterholes known to younger baboons, it is the oldest female who remembers another place to drink.

Orca pods tend to develop hunting tactics that are peculiar to the pod; the ones studied here preyed on salmon, and the grandmothers were dominant leaders in the years that salmon were scarce. A surprising implication here is that an orca apparently knows where it is in the open ocean, and where the salmon are likely to be found, and how to get from A to B. If this is the case, it would be a major advance over navigation along coast lines, which, for instance, might be adequate to get Pacific Grey Whales to their breeding lagoon in the Gulf of California.

<p>The assertion that descendants of the Common Emigrant did not have religion in the 1930s &mdash; which means that we did not have religion when we left Africa &mdash; challenges received wisdom. <a class="fn">Lowie<span>
	RH Lowie (1936) <cite>Primitive Religion</cite> (George Routledge &amp; Sons, London).
</span></a> claims that:
</p>

<blockquote>Religion is verily a universal feature of human culture &hellip; because all [societies] recognize in some form or other awe-inspiring, extraordinary manifestations of reality &hellip; connected with the sense of mystery or weirdness&hellip;
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">There is nothing in Lowie&apos;s description with the power to create a genetic need-to-believe. Raising an epiphenomenon to the status of a universal seems to be a common tendency among believers, yet religion is not among a more sober list of nearly 100 cultural universals proposed by <a class="fn">Donald Brown.<span>
	D Brown (1991) <cite>Human Universals</cite> (Temple University Press, Philadelphia).
</span></a> A number of its components are, including: admiration of altruism, beliefs about death, coalitions, death rituals, divination, feasting, gift giving, magical thinking, manipulative language, mourning, narratives, proverbs, sayings, symbolism, symbolic speech, rites of passage, ritual speech &mdash; but not a belief in spirits, an afterlife, a high god, or &mdash; critically &mdash; synthetic kinship. The difference is one of definition. Religion may be a cultural universal among those who made it out of the Middle Paleolithic, but related activity among Middle Paleolithic relict cultures is derivative and recently acquired.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, our concept of religion has moved on. Lowie&apos;s &lsquo;awe inspiring&rsquo; is too unfocused. Since the Enlightenment, religion has moved from both the awesomely misunderstood and the egotistically spiritual, and (at least in this book) must include as its defining feature, a supra-tribal mythos of synthetic kinship, aka brotherly love.

</h3>

<p>The designation &lsquo;BMH&rsquo; becomes ambiguous at this point. Traditionally, it means <i>Behaviorally</i> Modern Humans &mdash; that is, those that made the leap into the Upper Paleolithic. In <a href="#F10.1">Fig. 10.1</a> it means &lsquo;<i>Bicamerally</i> Modern Humans&rsquo;, as a differentiation from the later CMH, or &lsquo;<i>Conscious</i> Modern Humans&rsquo;. The problem is that not all bicameral BMHs are necessarily behavioral BMHs. More to the point, we do not know the origin of bicamerality either temporally or spatially. Because it requires a certain level of linguistic development, it is natural to associate it with the increasing linguistic skills of the Upper Paleolithic, as was implicitly done in <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#F2.3">Fig 2.3</a>. This interpretation implies that bicamerality was carried into Africa by back migration, and that it existed but was unrecorded in many early ethnological studies, so that knowledge of its geographical distribution is spotty, dependent upon indirect recognition. (Neither of these conditions is improbable, but we can wish once again that the concept had been current a century earlier.)
</p>

<p>We are resolutely ignoring a third problem, which is that the very hypothesis of bicamerality is accepted only by a minority of workers in the disciplines related to our topic. Many people still consider Jaynes&apos;s ideas to be mad, or, more generously, too speculative and their consequences too imponderable to be useful. Still, Ockham&apos;s Razor finds bicamerality indispensable in so many ways that it is more parsimonious to insert it long after we left Africa, than it is to explain religion without it.
</p>

<p>If we migrated up the South Asian rivers c 55 ka, there are 20,000 years in which to make the conversion from the &lsquo;chimpanzoid&rsquo; operating system to bicamerality, and this seems to be the myriennial period in which we have the least information about what our ancestors were up to. Perhaps, since the earliest recognized bicameral cultures are Mesopotamian, we were on the way to developing bicamerality by the time we crossed the Straits of Hormuz and reached the beaches of Persia.

<p class="epi">Modern humans are characterized by an unusual set of qualities: a capacity for abstract thought and communication, a remarkable degree of behavioural ﬂexibility, and signiﬁcant innovative capabilities, notably in the realm of technology. The interesting evolutionary questions are when, where, how and why these characteristics developed. &mdash; <a class="fn">O&apos;Connell &amp; Allen (2007)<span>
	JF O&apos;Connell, J Allen (2007) &lsquo;Pre-LGM Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea) and the Archaeology of Early Modern Humans&rsquo; In P Mellars &amp;3a (eds.) <cite>Rethinking the Human Revolution</cite>, (McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Cambridge UK): 395&ndash;410.: 403}.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>We inadvertently find ourselves in the middle of this centennial debate &mdash; and can perhaps contribute to its resolution (or fan the flames). The &lsquo;modern set&rsquo; is absent from Australia and New Guinea, whose tools resemble African Middle Stone Age, and signs of modernity do not show up until after the LGM. Neurological changes have been postulated for a number of prehistoric advances, specifically including the use of ochre and anything else that seems related to ritual. The chain of thought is that today rituals are important among behavioral modern humans, therefore they can be understood as an indication of modern abstract thought. Ritual seems almost universally conflated with religion by anthropologists. Yet the work of <a class="fn">Rappaport<span>
	RA Rappaport (1997) <cite>Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity</cite> (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge).
</span></a> and <a class="fn">Lansing<span>
	JS Lansing (1991) <cite>Priests and Programmerss: Technologies of Power in the Engineered Landscape of Bali</cite>. (Princeton University Press, Princeton).
</span></a> suggests strongly that ritual and religion serve different purposes, and may not be as closely related as received wisdom maintains. Ritual is a function of the reptilian brain, and its appearance in humans is perhaps more closely related to the courtship rituals of birds than to cortical development. It is close to superstition: if something worked once, it might work again &mdash; the <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> fallacy (&lsquo;after this, therefore <i>because</i> of this&rsquo;), which requires no more cortex than a cat&apos;s. This sort of confusion has persisted throughout history, so there is no reason to doubt either its appeal or its cohesive utility. Irish women on the bus to market cross themselves when they pass a church, unaware that they are doing so. Group ritual differs from superstition by requiring concerted activity, doing something together despite all other differences between us, and thereby minimizing the effect of those differences. But neither among Rappaport&apos;s New Guinea Tsembaga (where ritual was largely rallying for warfare) nor Lansing&apos;s Balinese (where water allotment to rice paddies was a matter of ritual) was there anything approaching a cortical understanding of why the ritual <a class="fn">worked.<span>
	The initiators of the system surely understood that there was a connection between dry paddies and subsequent good crops, even if the mechanism was not understood. This much can be achieved by good record keeping, which poses no problem for Buddhist monks. Much about origins can be forgotten in a millennium.
</span></a> They did it because they had always done it. Chimpanzees understand the cohesive use of ritual &mdash; no, &lsquo;understand&rsquo; is too strong: Chimpanzees <i>employ</i> the cohesive use of ritual. As do we.
</p>

<p>Technical advances were made throughout the Middle Paleolithic &mdash; but they did not become part of the culture because they<i> were not shared,</i> and they died with their inventors. <a class="fn">Two burin-drilled beads<span>
	RG Bednarik (1992a) &lsquo;Palaeoart and archaeological myths&rsquo; <cite>Cambridge Archaeological J.</cite> <b>2</b>(#1): 27&ndash;43.
</span></a> from Austria at 300 ka, show that one <i>erectus</i> made beads 250,000 years before the appearance of BMH. If no one else in your tribe has the patience to make beads (it takes an hour to make one), and your peers feel obliged to kill strangers on sight, bead-making is going to die with you. Similar failure happened time and again before there was a way to transmit new techniques &mdash; which, I suggest, is precisely what created the Upper Paleolithic. The advance was primarily social, and only secondarily technological.
</p>

<p>The synthetic-kinship hypothesis suggests that while the scattered beginnings can be traced back to <i>H. erectus</i> in the Middle Paleolithic, BMH is not only our own, but Eurasian. Exploring such events, Michigan professor <a class="fn">Robert Whallon<span>

<p>A critical mutation is one that inclined us to pothodoxy, or belief in a tribal story.

<p>Critically, later work showed two of the cultures living side by side &mdash; for the first time in prehistory, and between them defining what we mean by the Paleolithic Transition. Such peaceful interaction may have have been expected by multiregionalists &mdash; but certainly not by primatologists, who had experience with the behavior of primate bands. I suggest that this cohabitation was both unique and the most important event in our evolution.

(PCP) suggests that the ancestral language of Europe, Proto Indo-European, can be traced back into the Paleolithic. One of its findings is that the original Indo-European name of the bear was <i>*rkϸo-s</i> (The Destroyer), retained in Greek as <i>arctos</i> and Welsh as <i>arth</i>. But northern European languages from bear country used different names: <i>bjorn</i> (The Brown One), <i>datvi, guovza, karhu, loky</i> (The Shaggy Coat), <i>mathgamain, medved</i> (The Honey Eater), <i>urs</i>. This behavior can only result from a taboo. PCP places the common name of the bear in the Middle Paleolithic, specifically &lsquo;<b>prior to the beginning of religious belief</b>&rsquo;, and the new bear names in the Upper Paleolithic, when religious thinking begins and many <a class="fn" href="http://cloudline.org/LinguisticArchaeology.html">bear cults appear.<span>
	Recall that the saga of Ayla &mdash; who nearly single-handedly institutes the Transition in the <i>Earth&apos;s Children</i> books &mdash; begins in <i>The Clan of the Cave Bear</i>. Now we know why: Auel did her homework! [Click for more.]

</span></a> so that linguistic taboos, religion, and ethics appear nearly simultaneously (but, I suggest, in that order). The simplest trigger for this complex would appear to be sufficient language sophistication to support the Jaynesian operating system (as sketched in <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#F2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). This makes artefacts and environment subsidiary to the Great Leap, which begins inside the skull. The implication is that bicamerality developed in western Eurasia. (Yet late <a class="fn">bicamerality<span>

How did it get there?) Culture, strategy, and tool kits follow as soon as we don&apos;t have to kill eachother on sight.
</p>

<p>The change from bicamerality to consciousness, if we can judge by the Old Testament, took a millennium or more. This seems like a long time to us, but it is instantaneous by Paleolithic standards. If, as seems probable, bicamerality can be established simply by encouraging children to heed their &lsquo;invisible playmates&rsquo;, the Jaynesian OS might have spread through a Paleolithic tribe in a few generations.

<p>Before you can build a model, you have to have a scenario to model, so the first stage of quantitative evolutionary psychology is story telling. To eliminate just-so stories, there are rules for such &lsquo;evolutionarios&rsquo;, designed by <a class="fn">Bachofen and others.<span>

</span></a> With slight modification, the rules are:
</p>


<ol class="o2">
<li>Neither supernatural processes, nor</li>
<li>Teleological explanations are permitted to explain evolutionary change;</li>
<li>Valid adaptations must increase the viability of individuals in the group.

<p>Furthermore, the evolutionario should be:</p></li>
<li>Phylogenetically plausible;</li>
<li>Paleontologically adequate;</li>
<li>Evolutionarily feasible;

<p>and finally, it should</p></li>
<li>Exhibit explanatory specificity.</li>

<p>Rule 7 means that the evolutionario should not only explain why one group invented religion, but also why other groups did not.  We did not invent religion for 30,000 years after we left Africa, perhaps for the same reason that <i>H. erectus</i> did not. <i>Erectus</i> got along for 1.6 million years without it, so there is no reason why <i>sapiens</i> should immediately have found this new idea. It is possible that some evolving allele had to rise to an appreciable fraction of the inventing group, and like current religions &mdash; which all had single founders &mdash; it may have depended on the insight of a single individual.

<p class="epi">In discussing the origin of new customs altogether, we must keep in mind that the savages, like us, have their &lsquo;thinkers&rsquo; and savants &mdash; wizards, doctors, prophets, etc. &mdash; whose knowledge and ideas are in advance of those of the masses. United as they are in their secret unions (another almost universal feature) they are certainly capable of exercising a powerful influence, and of enforcing customs the utility of which may not yet be recognized by the majority of the tribe. &mdash; Kropotkin, <cite>Mutual Aid</cite>, p52n10.

<p>The role of shamans in tribal fights is psychological warfare, with pre-battle invocation of powerful spirits to terrify the enemy. However, they were more interested in the results of their efforts than in destroying their opponents: After invoking death and destruction on the enemy, Neolithic <a class="fn">druids<span>

<div class="tale">
<p>Late one Paleolithic afternoon, two bands met unexpectedly. The immediate reaction was to prepare to drive the Others away, because this is Our territory, and They need to have this explained to them in a memorable way. There are ritual insults between hunters, and some desultory rock throwing, but it is late in the day. We&apos;ll teach Them a lesson &mdash; tomorrow. Runners head back to the hunting camps to fetch shamans and whatever fighting support is available.
</p>

<p>By the time the morning sun is a full hand above the horizon, there seems to be no way to postpone the inevitable, so the shamans are sent out to whip the spirits into a warlike mood. But then, before beginning their terrifying spells, the smarter shaman says quietly to the other, &lsquo;Son of my grandmother&apos;s sister&apos;s daughter, why are we doing this? My totem tells me that this is not right.&rsquo; Astonished, his cousin replies, &lsquo;It is the way these things are done!&rsquo;. &lsquo;Yes, I know. But at the end of the day, what will it be? Some of the hunters will be wounded or killed &mdash; and you know who goes hungry when the hunters aren&apos;t successful!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are you getting at? Does your tribe want to run away?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course not. To hear them talk, they like to fight. But&rsquo;, pointing, &lsquo;have you been over that ridge?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;No. Why?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lots of game. Good grass. And a bunch of the big grunting people.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Them! They&apos;re strong!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;But slow. And there are more of us. If you count both tribes.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Unh?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;My totem says that if we ran them off, there would be good hunting for both of our tribes.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;But &mdash; &rsquo;
</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, we don&apos;t. We don&apos;t have to kill <i>Us</i>, we can kill <i>Them</i>. Everybody still gets to fight, but we don&apos;t start any more feuds, and we get a new hunting valley.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>They returned to the startled and suspicious hunters with a truce. Explaining that the totem spirits said it was an inauspicious day for fighting and that there was a more important task in hand, the brighter shaman sat the tribes in a circle. Inspired to mythopoesis in a bicameral trance, he told a tale which (correctly) defined the two tribes as related groups. The nasty Neandertals from the next valley were a common enemy. We can still fight, but we fight <i>Them</i>, and we fight together. So the adolescent football-hooligan* types dash off to spear the people who don&apos;t look like us, and the tribal elders discuss things, finding that together they can solve some problems that separately they could not.
</p>

<p>The immediate result, unremarked but far more important, was that after driving off the big grunting people, the two tribes ate together (including big-grunting-guy <a class="fn">livers),<span>

	The fingerbone from the Denisova cave (near the 4-nation quasi-contact of Russia, Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan), which turned out to belong to what was apparently a sister-taxon of Neandertal, was discovered late in my writing. There are now apparently 4 successful emergences of hominins from Africa: <i>erectus, H.s. neanderthalensis,</i> Denisovans, and <i>H.s. sapiens</i>. We interacted enough with Denisovans to acquire useful immune-system genes (which have since spread back to Africa). Denisova appears irrelevant to later events in Western Eurasia.

</span></a> thrusting spears was that neither tribe had the usual casualties, so the shamans &mdash; who had too often shared scraps with the hunting dogs &mdash; found life a bit better, and their status and perks increased a bit. They became apostles of Peace-through-Racism, and the idea spread. Game was abundant, so there was no <i>imperative</i> reason for fighting: it was mostly just alpha-male exhibitionism, for which Neandertals provide an ample outlet. In later centuries the priesthood has seized every opportunity for enhancing its power, and there is no reason to think it didn&apos;t happen in the Paleolithic. Perhaps the shamans noticed that reactions of people were more predictable than those of spirits, making intertribal negotiations the easiest way for shamans to be useful and deserving of a larger share of the hunt. (When did a Pope ever fight for table scraps?)

<p>What are the chances that Evolutionario 1 occurred?  It attributes a massive result &mdash; the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition &mdash; to a <a class="fn">single idea,<span>
	&lsquo;For reconstructing the past, it is considered better to favor the simplest scenario that can account for the patterns seen, even though many other, more complex scenarios are also possible.&rsquo; &mdash; S Pääbo (2014) <cite>Neaderthal Man</cite> (Basic Books, NYC): 195
</span></a> which might be expecting too much. Yet we should not underestimate the power of ideas just because we are dealing with a pre-literate society. Consider the Yanomamö and the New Guinea Highlanders. 30% and 24% of their adult male deaths are due to violence, respectively. Yet the apparent ferocity is not a desideratum but a last resort. In both societies these deaths result from commonplace disputes &mdash; simply because the societies involved know of no non-lethal ways to resolve serious matters like pig theft or alienation of affection. What we think of as &lsquo;crimes of passion&rsquo; are seen as natural and appropriate responses &mdash; and this is an attitude that persists among cultures of &lsquo;honor&rsquo; to this day.

<p>A qualification may be important here because of the apparent irreversibility of addiction to violence that <i>armoring and pothodox indoctrination</i> can induce. Attempts to talk captured terrorists out of violent jihad have met with mixed success, and, in the venerable tradition of missionaries and psychiatrists, have not been approached with scientific rigor.
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research road-sign"></a>
This is misuse of a golden opportunity to study armoring. It should be equipped with the full battery of tools to investigate the brain, from case histories and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventories to CAT-scans and magnetic-resonance imagery. In the absence of such studies, let our working hypothesis be that in a generally supportive environment, <i>and the absence of determined teaching otherwise</i>, people will prefer a culture in which they need not fear or kill strangers to one of interminable feuds.

<p>Evolutionario 1&apos;s &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need to kill US, we can kill THEM!&rsquo; is the first stage of the &lsquo;synthetic kinship&rsquo; hypothesis. Its second stage was the invention of a supratribal mythos and the first appearance of religious ideology. The third stage &mdash; which we have yet to take &mdash; will be the extension of the right of personhood to our <a class="fn">closest relatives,<span>

</span></a> so that we no longer kidnap, torture, and murder them. Nor would this extension exhaust the possibilities of synthetic kinship, as we gradually realize just how artificial the &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; qualification really is.
</p>

<p>However plausible the evolutionario may be, initially, there seemed no possibility of supporting the synthetic-kinship hypothesis with anything resembling data.

Nevertheless, I persevered, on the theory which I later found had been articulated by the editor of <cite>The White Goddess</cite>:

<p>Nothing integrates the multifarious aspects of a &lsquo;Great Leap&rsquo; better than the growth rate, which is the result of the key innovations of the Aurignacians. These include: numerous new types of bone, ivory and antler tools; blade technology (entirely lacking in the region&apos;s Middle Paleolithic); many kinds of lithic end scrapers, diverse burins, lateral and pointed resharpened blades using steep retouch; figurative art; abundant and diverse objects of personal ornament; tailored clothing, woven and sewn; and musical instruments.

<p>There are a number of other candidate genes, and sources, for introgressive genes, and for genes that affect the brain. <i>Something</i> is responsible for the 30-point IQ difference between the rain forest and the mammoth steppes, and there is no reason why some of it could not have come from an earlier exodus. Further speculation is idle, because this is a question that should be settled by research. Synthetic kinship, a simple idea that might quickly convert a fragmented, non-cooperating population into an interacting and idea-sharing one, in no way depends upon an increase in IQ. It would have profited by any change in the brain that decreased limbic amygdaloid fear and increased cortico-limbic acceptance of the stranger.

<p>In Europe, the essential consequence is that it was apparently the first time in 3.8 billion years of evolution that 2 groups of organisms using the same resources have not fought over them to the detriment of <a class="fn">both groups.<span>
	 Distrust and fear between groups does not preclude trade. The solution is a &lsquo;silent auction&rsquo; in which goods are placed on display and the sellers withdraw.

No one gets within fighting distance of the &lsquo;enemy&rsquo;.

</span></a> for death by warfare for contemporary societies range from 2% for the US and Europe in the 20th century, 20&ndash;40% for
half-a-dozen groups from the New Guinea highlands and the Amazon, to a high of 60% for the head-hunting Jivaro of the Andes, so 25% is not an exceptional value.) If we then stop killing eachother, it decreases the death rate of the newly non-violent culture by 25%. Obviously, this works best if the neighbors are also non-violent, but there should be sufficient interband communication to spread the idea across all members of a tribe.
</p>

<p>Translating a decrease in death rate to an increase in growth rate is problematic. However, if the maximum Paleolithic population in Fig. 10.9 was 8000, and half of it achieved in the 4000 years of rapid growth, we have an average increase of 1 person per year, from Iberia to Siberia &mdash; not what one ordinarily thinks of as &lsquo;rapid&rsquo; &mdash; so 1 less Aurignacian death per year is a significant change. The cultural advantage accrues to the tribe that doesn&apos;t kill the stranger bearing ideas, so talking to one stranger &mdash; instead of killing him &mdash; <i>once a year</i> is enough to explain the &lsquo;Great Leap&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Another estimate is a comparison of homicide rates. In civilized countries like England the rate is ~1 per 100,000 population per year. The UN says the global average is ~7, with the US ~10. &lsquo;Stone Age tribes make up in enthusiasm what they lack in the technology of murder&rsquo;, with the Yanomamö at 165 and the Hewa of the <a class="fn">New Guinea Highlands at 778.<span>

</span></a> No one seems to have tried to estimate a corresponding number for chimpanzees, but to one significant figure, the Paleolithic Transition was accompanied by &mdash; or, according to the synthetic-kinship hypothesis, <i>permitted by</i> &mdash; a 100-fold decrease in the murder rate.

<p>Long before their last stand in Gibraltar, Neandertals were locally extinct elsewhere. Instinct-1 will then have urged us to internecine fights, since nothing better was on offer. The <i>Pax Gravettica</i> could easily have broken down, but the genetic diversity density of Europe says that it did not. We may have exterminated Neandertals, Denisovans, <i>erectus</i>, etc, but we acccepted conspecifics, so it may have been here that we learned not to kill strangers on sight. This is, however, counter to our behavior since we started building walled cities in the Mesolithic. Can we account for this apparently peaceful period?
</p>

<p>The first time 2 tribes walked away from a fight to sit around a campfire and listen to why they hadn&apos;t killed eachother may have persuaded them that this was a good idea, but it was a pragmatic gambit and not yet a genetic endowment. New Guinea tribes fight their neighbors sequentially in a decadal cycle. Yet even here, <i>individuals</i> try to avoid fights. Strangers search for a common ancestor, so that they <i>won&apos;t</i> have to try to kill eachother. &lsquo;We don&apos;t have to kill them <i>today</i>&rsquo;, was a one-time tactical decision, but there must have been individuals early on who were thinking, &lsquo;Why do we have to kill them at all?&rsquo; Perhaps a good excuse was all that was needed to start the shift to genetics: the belligerent die young;  the pacifists survive.
</p>

<p>What we have so far is not yet religion. It is simple racism, devoid of overbelief, but it protects strangers who look right. It is what allows policemen carrying guns to talk to white suspects instead of shooting them on sight, as they so often do to black suspects. It was a giant step forward 35,000 years ago (if not quite adeqate for today&apos;s multiracial societies). Completing the shift from <i>racist</i>-protection-of-phenotype-strangers (look-like-me) to <i>religious</i>-protection-of-genotype-strangers (all humans) requires input from other influences at work on our ancestors, which we examine in the next 3 chapters. Protection-of-living-strangers &mdash; all life forms &mdash; requires post-religious concepts (e.g., Buddhism), but it is the next step. We must not leave the Urzeit hanging while we look at its contents, so we close this chapter with one of the more dramatic events of prehistory.

</h3>

<p>As for most marvelous and mysterious phenomena, there are many hypotheses about the why and wherefore of the cave paintings. With 17,000 years between Chauvet and Lascaux, there is time for reasons to come and go. Chauvet is apparently the earliest gallery, but there was rock art earlier, most of which has weathered away. This raises the question: Where else might a Paleolithic artist have found a permanent canvas? Australian Aborigines maintained rock paintings while being interviewed by anthropologists because the paintings were important to ceremonies of the Dreamtime.
 and Australian examples being updated while anthropologists interviewed the painters,  and shift emphasis, so perhaps many of them are true.
</p>

<p>Chauvet is apparently the earliest gallery, its animals are a unique set, and it was painted during the Urzeit. Remember, now, that the Cro-Magnon Aurignacians were just as smart as we are, they understood their world as well as (or better than) we do ours, and they seem to have been as interested in existential questions as we are. In Werner Herzog&apos;s film about Chauvet, <cite>The Cave of Forgotten Dreams</cite>, Wulf Hein plays the (pentatonic) Star-Spangled Banner on a 40,000-year-old bone flute from another group of Aurignacians in the Danube valley. (This does not mean that the flutemakers understood musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale">theory</a>; it means that they learned how to make a flute <a class="fn" href="http://www.flutopedia.com/index.htm">sound &lsquo;right&rsquo;.)<span>
	Makers of &lsquo;Native American Flutes&rsquo; have a variety of ways of placing the finger holes, only the most recent of which &mdash; the Dumbrill One-String method &mdash; recognizes theory, taking hole position from the fret placement of a notional 1-string guitar. [Click for more.]
</span></a>
</p>

<p>It is probably safe to say that these surprisingly sophisticated people had known Totems for 100,000 years, with little development of the idea in that period. Suddenly new hypotheses arise: the Totems themselves are related, and there is a Higher Power behind them. What does this mean? How is the Lion related to the Bison? We know, from a bent little-finger tip, that most of the handprints in Chauvet, both in the thickly populated panel, and singly, deeper in the cave, are made by the same person. How many artists drew the animals? Did an early philosopher use the cave walls (the largest, smoothest &lsquo;canvas&rsquo; then known) as her research tool, invoking the Totems and wondering how they were related?

<p>We may never know. But none of the usual hypotheses fits the zoological mix of Chauvet. I see a questioning mind at work here, using the best tools available to study the matter of humans&apos; place in the world, and our relation to the Others who share it with us. Who or What is the &lsquo;Mother of All Totems&rsquo;? Ecologists ask the first question today. The second remains unanswerable but challenging nonetheless. Why one favored planet which has plumbed so many of the existential mysteries? Why no sign of others? Why would we rather kill eachother and sequentially destroy our civilizations, when we could create a better life for all (us, and our colleagues from other Totems)? Why do we settle today for demonstrable fables? Why &hellip; ?

<p>The emerging bicameral mind resolved the question of the Higher Power by providing each brain with an inbuilt god (or pantheon). Like many evolutionary devices, this was a jury-rigged stop-gap which should have been temporary, dropping out of mind in the Axial Age in favor of introspective consciousness. Thanks to the split (<a href="../_A/A02.shtml#F2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>), this did not happen, and the gods persisted. By the time we needed to invent agriculture, the they were an established part of human experience, religions were universal, received wisdom held that this had always been the case. But no written record yet existed.
</p>

<p>At an 1895 Church Congress in Norwich, Professor Bonney, F.R.S., celebrated the centenary of the publication of the best known statement of Deism, Thomas Paine&apos;s <i>The Age of Reason</i>, saying,</p>

<blockquote>The story of Creation in the Book of Genesis, unless we play fast and loose either with words or with science, cannot be brought into harmony with what we have learnt from geology. Its ethnological statements are imperfect, if not sometimes inaccurate. The stories of the Fall, of the Flood, and of the Tower of Babel, are incredible in their present form. Some historical element may underlie many of the traditions in the first eleven chapters in that book, but this we cannot hope to recover.
</blockquote>

<p>Despite Bonney&apos;s pessimism, we have recovered the historical element underlying the Flood. Since this event is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" class="fn">earliest date<span>
	There are problems with radiocarbon dates, just as there are problems with determining the date of Jesus&apos;s birth. In both cases, the reasons for the problems are known. This is not the place for a tutorial on carbon-14, because Wikipedia has an extensive one [Click to read]. Suffice it to say that if the fundamentalist&apos;s disparagement of radiocarbon dates which conflict with their preconceptions reflects a failure of communication, it is because the receivers are turned off.
</span></a> we have for any critical event of living religions, it seems the logical termination of the Urzeit.
</p>

<p>We now know the Flood as the 5510 BCE filling of the Black Sea Depression. This story is told in <i>Noah&apos;s Flood</i>, by Columbia University oceanographers <a class="fn">
	William Ryan and Walter Pitman.<span> (1998) <cite>Noah&apos;s Flood</cite> (Simon and Schuster, NYC): 152.
</span></a> Ryan was codiscoverer of Miocene Mediterranean desiccation, so he was prepared to understand data from the Black Sea. The association of the Black Sea filling with Noah&apos;s flood is &lsquo;speculative and controversial&rsquo;, in Ryan&apos;s words, because it runs counter to prior interpretations of both the Bible and Black Sea. Yet it fits the facts better than any previous ideas, and as a fellow oceanographer, I do not find it either speculative or <a class="fn">controversial.<span>
	My immediate response was a reprise of Huxley on Darwin, &lsquo;How extremely stupid for me not to have thought of that!&rsquo;. There are a number of contradictory papers; perhaps the most cited is Aksu (2002), which denies eastward flow through the Bosporus. Yet its own data, in figures separated by many pages and not discussed, shows severe scouring outside the eastern end of the channel. More specifically, a core site on a map on one page, and radiocarbon dates from that core on another, shows 15,000 years of sediment loss compared to adjacent cores. This is an easy thing to miss <i>if</i> you are convinced there is nothing like this to look for. In any case, a paper whose authors claim refutes the filling turns out to support it. I mentioned this to Ryan, who said that he was planning to mention it at a coming symposium; I have no idea whether he convinced Aksu and his half-dozen co-authors. In any case, all contradictory papers ignore the deep channel cut into bedrock at the eastern end, where a hydrodynamic model showed exactly this sort of erosion (Siddall 2004).

</span></a> It is the only hypothesis which fits the facts Coyotl left recorded in the world.
</p>

<p>Among these facts is a banded series of salt strata near the Sicilian town of Messina, attributed to the &lsquo;Messinian Salinity Crisis&rsquo;, and dated to the latter Miocene (c. 7.25 Ma). The Crisis was caused by the northward movement of the African plate, which closed the Strait of Gibraltar. It takes the Med a millennium to dry, which leaves perhaps 200 m of evaporites (carbonates, gypsum, and salt) in the deepest region, with hypersaline lakes at the mouth of its rivers in a 5-km-deep valley hotter than the Dead Sea basin. The evaporite beds are <a class="fn">3 km at their thickest,<span>
	KJ Hsu, (1983) <cite>The Mediterranean Was a Desert:  A Voyage of the <i>Glomar Challenger</i></cite> (Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ).
</span></a> so Gibraltar must have opened and closed a dozen times.
</p>

<p>River mouths around the Med record the drop in sea level. The Ebro, Rhone, Po, and Nile &mdash; but not the Hellespont &mdash; have steep gorges cut in the Med&apos;s continental shelf. In 1973, when Russian engineers were measuring depths to bedrock in the Nile for the Aswan high dam, they found a narrow sediment-filled gorge cut <a class="fn">200-m into granite<span>
	IS Chumakof (1973) &lsquo;Geological history of the Mediterranean at the end of the Miocene&rsquo; in WBF Rhan, KJ Hsü et al. <cite>Initial reports of the DSDP</cite> <b>12</b>(#2): 1241&ndash;1242 (USGPO, WDC).
</span></a> &mdash; 1250 km upstream of the Mediterranean. Kayakers in the Miocene could have had a 780-mile run with sheer walls and fast flow all the way. Closer to the sea, the gorge was the size of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
</p>

<p>There is similar gorge 85 m deep in the bedrock of the Bosporus, but it empties into the Black Sea, a reverse of its normal flow. When the Bosporus is closed, major rivers maintain a fresh-water lake. Meanders and distributaries of the Don&apos;s flood-plain can be seen with sonar, 450 feet below current sea level and covered with a 1-meter blanket of fresh sediment.
</p>

<p>As Siberian ice melted about 12 ka, rivers which had been flowing south to the Black Sea found they could reach the North Sea more easily, so that during the Younger Dryas (12&ndash;11 ka) the level of the Black Sea dropped steadily, exposing large areas on its northern shore. By 8000 BP the water level was 155 m below current sea level. <a class="fn">Bob Ballard<span>
	RD Ballard, DF Coleman, GD Rosenberg (2000) &lsquo;Further evidence of abrupt Holocene drowning of the Black Sea shelf&rsquo; <cite>Marine Geology</cite> <b>170</b>: 253&ndash;261.>
</span></a> (of <i>Titanic</i> fame) examined a submerged beach of this lake offshore of the Turkish city of Sinope and found that it was drowned so fast that its mobile beach berm and sand bars are preserved as they were when active. The most recent fresh-water shells from the beach (periwinkle-like <i>Turricaspia</i>) were dated to 7460 BP (5510 BCE).
</p>

<p>Note in <a href="#F10.1">Fig. 10.1</a> that a Mini Ice Age follows 2000 years after the Ice Age. This resulted in the abandonment of many settlements in the Middle East as people moved to lower and warmer areas &mdash; like the shores of the &lsquo;Black Lake&rsquo;. The waning of this last small oscillation melted enough ice to raise sea level over the Bosporus Dam. This allowed 50 km<sup>3</sup>/day to make a 500&rsquo; waterfall &mdash; paltry compared to a filling of the Med, but no-one was around to <a class="fn">watch those.<span>

Black Sea before and after the opening of the Bosporus, 5510 BCE. Just as for today&apos;s slower sea-level rise, the major settlements were probably coastal. The exodus from the drowned lands &mdash; rather than anything related to the Caucasus Mountains at center right &mdash; is what gave the collective term &lsquo;Caucasians&rsquo; to the survivors.

<p>Anyone close enough to the waterfall to see what really happened was likely to have been washed away. The actual breach probably occurred with the help of a storm surge which locally raised sea level, and once the waterfall was under way it would have generated enough spray to obscure the scene from a distance. The surviving tales all come from the shoreline settlements, and they are so much alike that one suspects migration of details between traditions. Deucalion&apos;s story is contaminated by recollections of tectonic submergence of cities on the Mediterranean littoral. Other stories attribute the Black Sea waterfall to implausible &lsquo;waters above the firmament&rsquo;, leading to <a href="../_A/A04.shtml#F4.1">Fig. 4.1.</a>

<p>Utnapishtim, landing on Mt Nizir, sent out a dove, a swallow, and a raven, who never returned, and Deucalion sent out a series of doves. The echo in Gen. 8:7&ndash;12 suggests that Gilgamesh served as a model for Genesis. The priests of Israel, Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia agreed that their gods wanted to destroy mankind for wickedness and impiety. <a class="fn">Manu&apos;s ark <span>

</p>

<p>The people living by Black Sea Lake were not a homogenous group. Like animals driven to hilltops by floodwaters, they all lived elsewhere before cold dry climate pushed them into the refugium of the Depression. The duration of the flood varies, with 7, 9, and 40 days on offer, all too short for realism. These may reflect local shoreline slopes and thus the time available for escape. It was on the shores of the &lsquo;Black Lake&rsquo; that the shadowy link between Semitic and Indo-European cultures was formed. Perhaps the Indo-Europeans occupied the northern shore and the Semites the south. In any case, it was not the Lake, but the Caucasus mountains of its eastern coast, that gave their name to the refugees.

<p>As for what that drove Aryans to the Black Sea refugium, the <a class="fn">Iranian legends<span>
	A Mehta (1999) <cite>Zarathushtra. Introduction and First Six Chapters</cite>. Web Shareware Draft: 11.
</span></a> say:</p>

<blockquote>Yima son of Vivanghat was King of a fair and pleasant land &mdash; one which, although snowy in winter, became a delightful and glorious garden with the onset of Spring, with the coming of the New Year. However, because of the sins of the people &mdash; against which Yima the Righteous had warned them &mdash; nature, in a terrifying demonstration of Divine Judgement, turned the entire realm into an icy and bleak wilderness, where snow lay thick and heavy from the tops of mountains to the deepest valleys, and living things were killed off by fierce deadly frost. Some of the inhabitants, who fled south, escaped the wrath of Nature; but many perished <a class="fn">under the Ice.<span>
	Appealing as this connection may be, it is more likely that this legend comes from a later age and the inferred migration of the Indo-Iranians, from Siberia to the Altai-Sayan mountains and Mongolia, and southward into India, 3000&ndash;1000 BC.

<p>5500 BCE agrees roughly with Bishop Usher&apos;s calculation of the date of Creation from the lives of the patriarchs. This suggests that some tribal ancestors were memorable, others less so. As time passed, some dropped out of the lineage, with the lifetimes of the memorable extended to fill the gaps.

&lsquo;&hellip; we can kill THEM&rsquo; does not imply a great increase in Neandertal kills, just a decrease in <i>H. sapiens</i> kills. It does not preclude interbreeding, given the human propensity for sex with anything remotely feasible. Genetic evidence supports interbreeding &lsquo;with Neanderthals and Denisovans at least three different times in the past 100,000 years&rsquo;. &lsquo;The absence of Neanderthal mtDNA sequences in Europe is compatible with at most 120 admixture events between the two populations despite a likely cohabitation time of more than 12,000 years. This extremely low number may imply that &lsquo;the two populations were distinct biological species&rsquo; {Curr04} or only minimally interfertile, or it may be that any hybrids growing up among Neandertals were killed as Neandertals, while hybrids among <i>sapiens</i> may have been rejected at birth. Green et al. find 1&ndash;4% Neandertal genes in non-African <i>H. sapiens</i> and suggests 4 scenarios to explain them. Their absence of support for Scenario 2, &lsquo;gene flow between late Neandertals and early modern humans in Europe and/or western Asia&rsquo;, is compatible with Evolutionario 1, as is Scenario 4, &lsquo;old substructure in Africa that persisted from the origin of Neandertals until the ancestors of non-Africans left Africa&rsquo;. There are a number of sites with possible hybrid skeletons {Rogi54}, {Yaki80}, {Duar99}, but not everyone {Tatt99} is convinced.<a class="en" href="#Fn">F</a>
