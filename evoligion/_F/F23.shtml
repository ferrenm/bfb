<p>This chapter is about returning religion to its original Eirenic purpose, which goes far toward fixing it. It has nothing to say about theology, but everything to say about ultimate real world concerns and <a class="fn">Eric Hoffer&apos;s<span>
	E Hoffer (1951) <cite>The True Believer</cite> (HarperCollins eBooks, ?).
</span></a> <i>religiofication</i>, &lsquo;the art of turning practical purposes into holy causes&rsquo;. Everything that follows in this chapter is a potential subject of religiofication.
</p>

<p>With all due deference to the Occupy Movement, the real problem is not the catchy &lsquo;1%&rsquo;, or even my reduction to the 1&permil;. The core is the 0.0000063% who provide 80% of the <a class="fn">campaign funds.<span>
	L Lessig (2012) <cite>One Way Forward</cite> (Byliner, San Francisco).
</span></a> That&apos;s about a quarter of the 85 people in the world who own as much wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion. Our politicians &mdash; having been bought by them &mdash; govern for them. In my Sierra Club days, I once bearded a local politician who was, by my assessment and his own admission, actively working to destroy the appeal of Santa Barbara as desirable place to live (at the time, it compared favorably with the French Riviera). His response was a shrug and &lsquo;It&apos;ll last my time&rsquo; &mdash; and his time was made more pleasant by contributions from local &lsquo;developers&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>A relevant example is the <a href="../_E/E20.shtml#16">public (dis)utilities</a>. Decades of generous campaign contributions have bought them 46 subsidies, tax breaks, incentives and deductions which annually transfer G$11 from taxpayers to conventional-energy companies.  This is 6 times the support for renewable energy, and unlike it, does not need to be renewed every year. It must be terminated deliberately. This was the purpose of the &lsquo;End Polluter Welfare Act of 2012&rsquo; introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders &mdash; and predictably killed by the Finance Committee. (Recall <a href="../_E/E20.shtml#F20.13">Fig. 20.13</a> and its suggestion that by 2100, all of our energy must be <a class="fn">renewable.)<span>
	Germany reached 74% renewable energy (on good days) by 2014-05-20.

<p>The modern tyrant governs from behind the throne. Eliminating ours in the Athenian manner might be fun and soul-satisfying, but it would not be effective. The problem is systemic: We no longer own our government, and it will not work for us until we do. We cannot expect legislation, adjudication, or executive action to be for our benefit until our politicians, judges, and administrators are once again <i>our</i> employees. Taxpayers cannot outbid the tyrants in an open auction, and it would attract the wrong people, for we do not want greedy people in government! The fix lies in another direction.

<p>Loss of control, and its destruction of the American dream, has been episodic, with post-Civil-War and the last 30 years being the worst periods. Figure 23.1 suggests that another FDR might be useful, but such candidates are thin on the ground.

<p class="epi">I seek to preach into the ears of the able and rich and powerful the great truth that neglect of the sufferings of their fellows, indifference to the great bond of brotherhood which lies at the base of Christianity, and blind, brutal and degrading worship of mere wealth, must &hellip; eventuate in the overthrow of society and the destruction of civilization. &hellip; I tell [the churches] that if Religion is to reassume her ancient station, as crowned mistress of the souls of men, she must stand [as] the champion and defender of mankind against all its oppressors. &mdash; Ignatius Donnely, writing his dystopian <cite>Caesar&apos;s Column</cite> as Edmund Boisgilbert in 1890, badly underestimated exponential scientific and technological advances, but was spot on with the unchanging nature of politics. </span></a></p>

<p><a class="fn">Some<span>S Moore (2012) &lsquo;The U.S. Tax System: Who Really Pays?&rsquo; <cite>Issues</cite> #<b>22</b> (Manhattan Institute).</span></a> will tell you that inequality is good because it is the investments of the rich that drive innovation. <a class="fn">Others<span>••••••••••</span></a> point out that the process is far more complex, so that inequality can either drive or kill innovation. <a class="fn">Yet others<span>W Baldwin (2013) &lsquo;How Retirees Pay Zero Taxes&rsquo; <cite>Forbes</cite> 2013-06-24.</span></a> find that the rich prefer safe, tax-free investments. In this welter of interested advice, one distinguishing feature stands out: the people who advocate inequality are the ones who benefit <i>directly</i> from it. They tend to be the 1&permil;. The high correlations between the 1&permil; and CEOs, between CEOs and psychopathy, and between psychopathy and lying, suggest taking the benefits of inequality with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>A little thought shows that economic inequality has a fundamental flaw: it grows exponentially. Non-mathematicians refer to this aspect as &lsquo;Them as has, gets&rsquo;. Wealth concentrates &mdash; but Adam Smith&apos;s &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo;, which is the solitary justification for market economics, requires multitudinous decision makers. A sustainable market accordingly requires either periodic redistribution (&lsquo;Jubilee years&rsquo;) or carefully graded income and transaction taxes, or some other statutory method that <i>corrects</i> automatic accretion. The random nature of the stock market may obscure the automatic nature of concentration, and it is a moot point whether those of the 1&permil; who tell us about their hard work and market skill believe this, or are just serving up the party line.

Inequality. Wealth owned by the top 10% of the US population in reported income. The clear implication is that without the New Deal, the 10% would now own 2/3 of the national wealth. During the 2002&ndash;2007 &lsquo;Bush Expansion&rsquo;, 65% of the total gain went to the top 1% (income > $400,000) and 6% to the <a class="fn">top 1&permil;<span>
	E Saez (2012) &lsquo;Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Update with 2010 estimates)&rsquo;<cite> Pathways Magazine</cite>, Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality, Winter 2008: 6&ndash;7</span></a>
(income > $11,000,000). The 50-year interruption and resentment implied by the cyan area seems adequate to explain the red area marking the relentless efforts of recent Republican legislation to get back on track, beginning with the <a href="http://reclaimdemocracy.org/powell_memo_lewis/"><cite>Powell Memorandum</cite></a>, ALEC and Heritage. The net effect is shown by the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/09/productivity-and-growth">inset graph</a> of business productivity (added much later, and not to scale: only the growth-rate change matters).


<p>What Fig. 23.1 indicates is that from 1932 to 1972 the 1.96% surplus value of US business was widely distributed as wages to the working class, salaries to management, and taxes to the public purse. The fundamental feature of the later period is that the 1‰ figured out how to monopolize 2/3 of the surplus value, thereby destroying the middle class and removing the government&apos;s ability to maintain &mdash; let alone improve &mdash; societal infrastructure.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics may not be willing to explain the ‘something’ that happened in the mid-70s, but it was the same Powell Memorandum, ALEC, and Heritage Foundation of Fig. 23.1. Evidently our  business colleges see the productivity increase in Fg. 23.2 as beneficial, while ignoring the total productivity decrease of Fig. 23.1. (Both graphs came from <cite>The Economist</cite>.)
</figcaption></figure>

<p>While the destruction of the middle class seems blatantly deliberate, and the mechanism well understood, there are those who see things differently. From a comment in the <a href="http://www.eoionline.org/blog/x-marks-the-spot-where-inequality-took-root-dig-here/">blog</a> that displayed this graph:
</p>

<blockquote> While &lsquo;greed&rsquo; may be one characteristic, you leave out the substantial disruptions in society that occurred at the inflection point: Roe v Wade <b>devalued life</b>, No-fault divorce, <b>encroachments</b> in the labor/management relationship by an intrusive Federal Government, massive increases in State and Federal <b>regulation</b>, massive growth in State and Federal taxation, massive growth in entitlement spending, and massive increases in Federal debt. These are but few. &mdash; William Vaughn &mdash; 2015-08-10 (emphasis added).
</blockquote>

<p>Just to set the record straight, no-fault divorce and Roe v Wade are irrelevant. The &lsquo;devaluation of life&rsquo; was produced by the wage theft that flatlined workers&apos; pay. (The anti-abortion movement has never understood that teen pregnancy is driven by the same biological imperative that drives their feeling that we need all the babies we can produce: the species that doesn’t reproduce goes extinct. This was no longer a problem for us after we stopped killing strangers on sight 35,000 years ago, but our genes have <a class="fn">not caught up.)<span>
	Genes are permanent unless there is selection against them. There will not be selective pressure against overpopulation even though a case can be made that the US&apos;s permanent wars and the civil wars of the Middle East are both indications that we have exceeded the planet&apos;s carrying capacity.
</span></a> The &lsquo;encroachments&rsquo; of the 1970s that permitted wage theft were the deliberate destruction of the social protections of the New Deal. The regulations were those required by population pressure on the environment and by corporate unconcern for the health and safety of workers. The various fiscal problems were as much caused by the failure of corporations to pay the allotted taxes &mdash; an indication that the process does not work and needs replacement, probably by heavier taxes on individuals like myself whose pension comes from <a class="fn">corporate profit.<span>
	If my taxes were doubled, life would still go on.
</span></a> &lsquo;Free trade&rsquo; does not work fairly between regions with disparate economic systems.
</p>

<p>The view of growing US inequality given by Figs. 23.1 and 23.2 does not include capital gains, and it does not show the inequality of the top 1‰, which has recently risen much faster: in 2010, the top 1% got 93% of the annual increase, and CEOs grabbed 243 times the median wage. When Paul Krugman showed a version of this graph on his &lsquo;Conscience of a Liberal&rsquo; blog, a reader asked, &lsquo;You seem to assume that inequality is bad. Why?&rsquo; By 250 BCE the Romans had already learned that civil strife arises from economic inequality, so why is this not common knowledge today? If any single question reveals the failure of the educational and religious institutions of the nation, it is this one!

The greater the concentration of wealth, the greater its power to increase its concentration (for-profit-wars; the bank &lsquo;bailout&rsquo; of 2008, <i>Citizens United</i>), influence public policy (the stolen elections of 2000 and 2004), and protect itself against citizen dissent (the &lsquo;Patriot&rsquo; Act).
</p>

<p>170 years ago, <a class="fn">Alexis de Tocqueville<span>(1841) <cite>Democracy in America: Relation to Political</cite> Vol.1 4th ed. (Langley, NYC): 1.</span></a>  opened his analysis of <cite>Democracy in America</cite> with the remarkable fact of equality:
</p>

<blockquote>The more I advanced in the study of American society, the more I perceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from which all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all my observations constantly terminated.
</blockquote>

<p>Profiteering during the Civil War began the erasure of this &lsquo;fundamental fact&rsquo;, and inequality was well established by the start of Fig. 23.1, which celebrates a 4-decade return to partial equality. The Depression &mdash; which I see as an intentional, if bungled, bit of bankerly money management &mdash; inadvertently led to FDR (hence the &lsquo;bungled&rsquo;), and FDR led to the best 40 years of the &lsquo;general Welfare&rsquo; sought by the Constitution (1943&ndash;1973). I do not know what thereafter went wrong, aside from the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, but it was intentional. If we had the same tax rules in 2012 that we had in 1972, there would be no Federal deficit. (Actually, since writing that, I have come across the Powell Memorandum, which seems to have been the wake-up call that started the decline. Do look it up in Wikipedia.)
</p>

<p>&lsquo;But what&rsquo;, the good church-goer might ask, &lsquo;has all this to do with religion?&rsquo; Although Christianity and Islam offer little guidance, Buddha, teaching Eirenic doctrine with never a mention of a god, and anticipating the philosophy of FDR&apos;s New Deal by 2500 years, instructed the ruler:
</p>

<blockquote>The root of social evil was poverty and unemployment. This was not to be bribed away by charity and donations, which would only reward and further stimulate evil action. The correct way was to supply seed and food to those who lived by agriculture and cattle-breeding. Those who lived by trade should be furnished with the necessary capital. &hellip; A citizen could bring up his children in comfort and happiness, free from want and fear, in such a productive and contented environment. The best way of spending surplus accumulation, whether in the treasury or from voluntary private donations, would be in public works such as digging wells and water ponds and planting groves along the trade routes. &mdash; <a class="fn">Kosambi 1965.<span>

World Inequality. The spikes are quantization binning, the smooth red-filled curve is a lognormal distribution.

<p>For things which increase multiplicatively instead of additively  (ie, one gets a 5% raise rather than a $5 raise), the lognormal theoretical curve of Fig. 23.2 is equivalent to the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; or &lsquo;Gaussian&rsquo; &lsquo;bell curve&rsquo; for things that increase linearly. I suspect that this graph is a constant inspiration to the CEO class: look how far above the world mean the US poverty threshold lies. This differential represents unclaimed wealth to the CEO who can figure out how to capture it.

	A Reynolds (2007) &lsquo;Has US income inequality really increased?&rsquo; <cite>Policy Analysis</cite> #586 2007-01-08.
</span></a> published an article explaining that the apparent increase in CEO pay was merely a shift of income description in response to tax-law changes: &lsquo;When top tax rates on wages or capital gains fall, reported incomes rise, and a larger fraction of the incomes of those at the top show up on tax returns&rsquo;. Oddly, this argument was originally a left-wing <a class="fn">criticism of CEO behavior,<span>

This beggar-thy-neighbor approach begins with a helpful loan from the World Bank, which pays a US company (e.g., Haliburton, Bechtel &mdash; never a local company) to build infrastructure.

<p>Figure 23.3 shows the results achieved in this way. National household income is stratified into quartiles. The bottom line is that during 40 years when everyone was making optimistic noises about world progress, almost 2/3 of the nations dropped into a lower quartile. The income ratio between the richest and poorest world pentiles (20% of the population) was 30:1 in 1960 and 74:1 in 1998; this is intentional.

<p>There are exceptions:
</p>

<p>In Ghana, the IMF approach cut public service, made the poor poorer, and put cash crops and trade before welfare. The IMF insisted on meters for Ghana&apos;s water supply, demanding full cash recovery for the service, steeply raising costs for the poorest.

<p class="epi">The &lsquo;working poor&rsquo; [&hellip;] are in fact the major philanthropists of our society. They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high. To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else. &mdash; <a class="fn">Barbara Ehrenreich (2001) <span><cite>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</cite> (Granta Books, London).</span></a>

<p>Within-nation inequality is determined by government policy. Figure 23.4 compares British and US domestic economic policy under partisan governments. The upward kink on the right is part of the price we pay for an upper house: it <i>will</i> legislate for its own advantage. (Two things we might do about this: a maximum-wealth limit on members, and legislative pay that was some small multiple of that of the lowest pentile.) The <i>display</i> of US data in Fig. 23.4 was apparently chosen to remove the sharp differences seen in the extremes of the British data. This graph shows unequivocally that during its 50-year period, our laws have steadfastly been written for the benefit of those who can buy a seat in the upper house.
</p>

<p>Despite this historical data, 2/3 of the Republican voters in the 2014 mid-term election were worried about the economy. Yet they voted against their own best interest. This is ignorance, or racism, or they are influenced by advertizing, but it is not voting to improve the economy.
</p>

<p>&rsquo;Socialism&rsquo; is a dirty word in the US, thanks to a sustained campaign of disinformation. This campaign, and the irrational rejection it generates among those who would benefit most from a diminution of inequality, is a propaganda triumph. The persistent use of &lsquo;socialist&rsquo; as a fear-mongering pejorative by paranoid business leaders, politicians (and the Catholic Church, because Socialism favors education and free thinking) &mdash; stems from the early 20th century, when there was an actively growing Socialist Party. Nevertheless, one of the purposes of the Constitution was to &lsquo;promote the general Welfare&rsquo;, which is the Socialist goal. One could make the case that Fig. 23.4 demonstrates 50 years of unconstitutional fiscal laws, with a Supreme Court appointed to let them stand.

<p>Numerate voters would not vote for US Republicans or British Conservatives, since everyone but the top few are always better off under the Democrats and Labor. An explicit example is US private-sector job creation (no one is keeping track of the offshore jobs created by globalization):</p>

<ul>
<li>Bush 1 + Bush 2,  19,385 </li>
<li>Carter + Obama,  407,028 </li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">making it clear that government policy <i>does</i> influence workers&apos; wellbeing. Instinct-1-driven Republicans/Conservatives see only that labor costs are lower overseas, and the savings go into higher management pay; Democrats/Labor, with a wider perspective, understand that if they want people to buy their products, people must have disposable income from a living wage. Call it a factor of 20 in favor of the Democrats &mdash; but this is not the popular perception. The combination of billionaire political ads allowed by <i>Citizens United</i>, SCOTUS&apos;s permission for Fox &lsquo;News&rsquo; to lie, and the failure of schools to teach numeracy, leaves the public voting against their own best interests. (An immediate corollary is that Republican/Conservative legislators, school boards, and textbook publishers will work diligently to keep voters innumerate.)

<p>If Thatcher&apos;s regressive Conservative approach was publicly acceptable: &lsquo;the top 5% gain&rsquo;, then the &lsquo;Desideratum&rsquo; line should be more acceptable: &lsquo;the 30% who need it most, gain&rsquo;. The smoothness of the curves suggests sophisticated management to abrogate the central concept of liberal democracy &mdash; &lsquo;Liberté, <b>Egalité</b>, Fraternité&rsquo; &mdash; in favor of top-heavy instability. The same sophistication might be applied to generate the &lsquo;Desideratum&rsquo; curve, which would gradually correct inequality while hurting no one <i>financially</i> (although the psychological pain of wounded <i>amour propre</i> on the right would be extreme, and certain news media would need the usual treatment accorded rabid foxes).</span></a>

<p>To some, the top-heavy approach is inevitable and proper. Wealthy aristocrats (identified by the gods with white skin and inherited money) will employ the virtuous among the serfs, so benefits will trickle down to such of the yeomanry as deserve them. This worked for 1000 years, and there is no reason to change a working system.
</p>

<p>Reality is different. The burden of Wilkinson and Pickett&apos;s <cite>The Spirit Level</cite> is that inequality is bad for our health. It may seem strange for health-scientists to intrude upon the domain of economists, but their meta-analysis of hundreds of health-related surveys shows that for all definable civic units (villages to countries), economic inequality decreases things the wealthy cannot buy, such as longevity, health, happiness, and trust, and increases those they dislike: total homicides, obesity, mental illness, diabetes mortality, teen-age pregnancy, drug use, and violence. It is not the average income that matters, but <a class="fn">the discrepancy<span>Wilkinson, R & K Pickett (2009) <cite>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</cite> (Bloomsbury Press, NYC).</span></a> between the top and bottom. (The obvious solution, to our &lsquo;elites&rsquo;, is to suppress all public mention of inequality. &lsquo;What people don&apos;t know can&apos;t hurt us.&rsquo;)
</p>

<p>The mechanism is simple envy, or,  expanded, &lsquo;the stresses, insecurities and anxieties caused by bigger social status differences and more status competition&rsquo;, which add to the pressure to consume and increase sensitivity to being disrespected, which is often a trigger for violence. Studies consistently find that 26&ndash;38% of the US population have some form of <a class="fn" href="../_F/F21.shtml#16">mental illness<span>

<p>All social regulators introduce friction and inefficiency into the system &mdash; but not as much as is introduced by the lies and thievery of the unregulated system. When distrust reaches critical levels, society grinds to a halt. This is the case in many less developed nations, and while called the &lsquo;poverty trap&rsquo;, it is entirely the work of Instinct-1. We see the effects in low voter turnout, by people convinced that there is no longer a &lsquo;lesser evil&rsquo; to vote for.
</p>

<p>The reason that we at the top should demand a more equal society is purely selfish. In terms that the most successful pillar of the community (or most arrogant, avaricious, egocentric, and overpaid alpha male &mdash; if these differ) can appreciate, if not understand, he will live longer, in better health, with less fear of violence, and his kids will do better in school, in an egalitarian society which will cost him less in taxes, offer a higher rate of return on investment, and deliver improvements in the standard of living <a class="fn">more often.<span>

Why, with a popular mandate of that size, have legislators not responded? Cravenness? Stupidity? The economic friction of lobbyists?  A candidate-vetting process that ensures a proper respect for privilege?
</p>

<p>We should remember that the filthy rich seldom get that way on their own merit. More often, their mothers got them a contract with IBM, the government gave them land along the railway, they ran rum and opium or exploited coal miners, Daddy owned a bank or an iron mine, their Congressman got a bill passed. Luck, connivance, Old Boy networks, and tax loopholes. These produce the real inefficiencies in the system, and they need correcting in pursuit of a better life for everyone.

</span></a> &lsquo;since the natural inequality of men dooms many of us to poverty and defeat, some supernatural hope may be the only alternative to despair. Destroy that hope, and class warfare is intensified&rsquo;. This may not be as true as the Durants thought, because <i>natural</i> inequality usually falls on a normal (Gaussian) curve, while financial inequality tends to be exponentially hyperbolic, as in Fig. 23.5. If we reduced the income inequality to match natural inequality, we might be able to reduce the the supernatural content of religion in proportion. We cannot gracefully abolish <i>natural</i> inequality, but nothing keeps us from matching income more closely to ability. It takes egregious arrogance to believe that you are <i>really</i> &lsquo;worth&rsquo; 100 times the other guy.

US Income vs Natural Inequality &mdash; a rough cartoon. Inequality for most human abilities follows a Gaussian distribution, scaled at the left. The rising curved blue line sketches the US income distribution, log-scaled on the right. The red-shaded area seems to cause the problems of inequality. (If logarithmic scaling does not immediately register, an income between log 5 and 6 is a &lsquo;6-figure&rsquo; income.)

<p>The inner Gaussian of Fig. 23.6 is for IQ, as in <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#F1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>; the outer Gaussian is notional, for any ability more broadly distributed. The small circle at $46,000 is the mean US income. The blue line is an approximating hyperbola, rising from $4640 at the left, through $46,000 in the center to $65,000,000 at the right. (The top 400 taxpayers took home an average of $87,000,000 so the curve is conservative.) The straight line rises to $464,000 on the right, essentially 100 times the lowest pay on the left. Pathological cases excepted, it is hard to find any two people whose innate abilities differ by factor of 100. Why should their relative income differential be any greater?

<p>Nick Hanauer &mdash; multibillionaire &mdash; offers a relatively painless approach. Like Henry Ford, he noticed that it was the middle class workers who were primarily responsible for the market pressure that creates jobs. The dominant solution to unemployment, then, is a larger middle class demanding products, which means a larger middle class with disposable income, which in turn means a larger middle class with a living wage. It does the economy no good at all if most of the surplus value created by workers is appropriate by management. As Hanauer points out, he may have a yacht and a <a class="fn">jet airplane,<span>
	In addition to his own family business (pillows), he was the first non-family investor in his friend Jeff Bezos&apos;s on-line bookstore, otherwise known as Amazon.
</span></a> but he is only one customer at Wal-Mart, and
</p>

<blockquote>Wal-Mart could, say, pay each of its 1 million lowest-paid workers an extra $10,000 per year, raise them all out of poverty and enable them to, of all things, afford to shop at Wal-Mart. &mdash;  <a class="fn" href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014_Page3.html#.U6-yfKhD2nw">N Hanauer</a>
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">This would leave G$1.5 for the Wal-Mart family&apos;s annual profit, instead of their current G$2.5.
</p>

<p>And how do we arrange for this to happen? With government interference, providing the &lsquo;same kinds of rules as, say, the transportation system, with its speed limits and stop signs&rsquo;. The simplest automatic approach is to adjust the minimum wage to compensate for (annual) inflation. This has the added benefit of inspiring every employer to resist inflation.

<p>In 2013, 16-year-old Ethan Couch, drunk, drove into a Texas crowd and killed 4 people. His lawyers claimed that he suffered from &lsquo;<a class="glb" href="../_G/Glo.shtml#aff">affluenza</a>&rsquo;, he <a class="fn">grew up rich<span>
	Family wealth is reportedly a mere M$15, so imagine how ethically challenged the offspring of billionaires are likely to be!
</span></a> so he didn&apos;t know right from wrong and thus couldn&apos;t be held responsible for his actions. This not only worked, but established a precedent that seems to go to the root of the problem, and so can be applied broadly: <b>If you grew up rich the prima facie assumption is that you never had to learn right from wrong, so you are ipso facto disqualified from positions of responsibility.</b> Anyone desirous of challenging the assumption and entering public life as a responsible adult could take a battery of psychological tests which would become part of the public record, allowing us to weed out the psychopaths and greedy. (I envision high-security &lsquo;retirement homes&rsquo;, where the rejects can scheme their way through multiplayer computer games that let them embezzle, bribe, and corrupt their way to incredible &mdash; if imaginary &mdash; wealth, titles, and congratulatory screen displays of fireworks.)

<p>The Eirenic goals of Table 23.1 are not new. They are what 150 years of missionaries and quangos have been striving for. What is new is their urgency. As Lester Brown makes clear, &lsquo;The choice will be made by our generation, but it will affect life on earth for all generations to come.&rsquo; Embarrassingly, we have wasted years since <cite>Plan B 1.0</cite>, dealing instead with the effects of bankerly greed, and spending time, lives, and treasure on gratuitous destruction in the Middle East.
</p>

<p>Because the goals of Table 23.1 are so commonplace, we may not immediately see that a subsidiary benefit would be to raise the mean world IQ by 5&ndash;10 points. Most entries contribute strongly to operational intelligence. Recall <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#F1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>, and the large effect that raising mean IQ has on the number of outliers at the high end. These simple steps might be enough to let the world&apos;s failing states rejoin the civilized world within a generation, under their own power.
</p>

<p>If throwing money at Table 23.1 were the only challenge, we could be living in a real, functioning utopia in 30 years. If we had embarked on this project in 1980, we would now be as close to utopia as we are likely to get. However, money is not the problem: As Brown explains, this would cost us less than we are currently spending on socially destructive projects. The problem is that some of the requisite steps reduce the income of the overpaid, and will be stoutly opposed by their dependents in governments, the media, academia, and the churches. Stewardship of the world begins at home, and there are many aspects of US and Western culture where housecleaning is in order.

<p>This &mdash; in a country that once prided itself on being the technological leader of the world! The reason for this failure to maintain the essential underpinnings of civilization is the reluctance of the 1&permil; to spend money on anything that does not directly increase their wealth or wellbeing, plus their ability to buy Congress. The resulting bias raises a curious question about economics. (To keep jargon straight here, let us think of infrastructure maintenance as an economic <i>good</i>, and war matériel as an economic <i>bad</i>.)
</p>

<p>The 1&permil; are happy for the country to spend money on armaments, warfare, and the destruction of infrastructure elsewhere. We have no immediate quarrel with the immorality, bloodlust, and fascism revealed by that attitude: If these values were constrained to private relations among the 1&permil; we could market the results as reality TV and enjoy them. Our quarrel is with the <i>public</i> manifestation of these sterling qualities, which is a matter of criminal oversight. We owe it to the Founding Fathers and the American Dream to find a harmless way for psychopaths to amuse themselves that does not incidentally destroy the world.
</p>

<p>The sociopathic economic system that results when we let these socially challenged individuals run free &mdash; ie, feudofascism &mdash; has so warped the market that the return-on-investment (ROI) in <i>goods</i> (infrastructure, maintenance, social cohesion) is lower than the ROI on <i>bads</i> (armaments, destruction, misery). Dominated by a country that hasn&apos;t been attacked since 1812, the &lsquo;free market&rsquo; describes a culture of misinformed paranoia, manipulated fear, and institutionalized greed. Is this really the way you want your government to describe you to the world?

<p>If the ROI of goods in the US stock market exceeded the ROI of

<p>Gross inequality indicates that those at the top are greedy and, like tapeworms, obnoxious.

	Bankers prefer to gamble with other people&apos;s money, particularly on high-risk (and potentially high-profit) investments. Glass-Steagall (1933) was an attempt to separate risky investment banks from dependable depositary banks, minimizing the inherent conflict of interest and the chance of deposit banks going belly up from bad investment decisions. By 1970 banks and their tame regulators had found loopholes, detours, and new financial instruments that effectively nullified G-S by 1989. Its remaining provisions were eliminated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (&lsquo;glibba&rsquo;) Financial Modernization Act of 1999, paving the way for the depredations of 2008.

</span></a> this means that the small-scale approach <i>works</i>, and that we could improve things by removing offenders from the gene pool (assassinate the guilty in the Athenian manner; sterilize their offspring). Unfortunately, this works better, the smaller the gene pool. (Rigorously applied in the US of 1776&ndash;1820 &mdash; &lsquo;before the rot set in&rsquo; &mdash; it might have helped, but continued immigration rebuilds the gene pool.)
</p>

<p>The public face of proper societal behavior, of what we might call macroethics, is philosophically simpler than the private face of individual behavior, or microethics. While every economist has considered the problem, it was perhaps most starkly posed as:
</p>

	I was not aware, when I wrote this sentence, that it is perilously close to creating a new &lsquo;theory of value&rsquo;. It seems perfectly obvious that the amazing increase of productivity beyond the guilds of the Middle Ages results from laboratory research, unrelated inventions, and public infrastructure networks of water, energy, transport, and information &mdash; none of which belong to the labor or management camps, and which therefore rightly belongs to the &lsquo;people&rsquo;. Surely there&apos;s a formal theory that describes this? (If one were to claim that business entities already paid their fare share for all of these services as normal business expenses, one might then ask, &lsquo;Why it is that the American Society of Civil Engineers routinely gives us a grade of D for infrastructure maintenance&rsquo;? We clearly do not pay as we go, and the cost to repair has tripled to G$4 in the last decade.)

<p class="flu">It was perhaps too obvious after he said it in print, for it brought the wrath of Capitalism and Communism alike down upon the Cooperative Movement in their solitary example of &lsquo;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&rsquo; reaction. In practice, the consumers of the Co-ops were the stockholders of the Co-ops. Selling goods at the same price as capitalist enterprises generated dividends which were distributed in proportion to purchases. The small return of many &lsquo;stockholders&rsquo; did not, in the end, seem worth the detailed bookkeeping, and few co-ops survived the relentless machinations of the capitalist effort to appropriate the surplus value for themselves.
</p>

<p>The Constitutional goal of &lsquo;promoting the general Welfare&rsquo; requires that both the surplus value and the ownership of the means of production be distributed equitably across the population. Most of our billionaires have simply appropriated the surplus value because their Senators have written laws that allow them to. The question is how to correct this oversight in a more dignified manner than the violent oscillations of the French Revolution, and more effectively than any &lsquo;communist&rsquo; revolution. (Both found it expedient to kill off their parasites, and both overshot the optimum kill. A more attentive student of revolutions than I might find some that have done better.)

<p> I have always found economics suspect, whether it be the unquantified straight-line graphs of Economics 101 (unrealistic!), the jargon-filled journal papers assuming that growth is the <i>summum bonum</i> (why?), or the inability of experts to agree on fundamentals (recall the Cold War and the financial fiasco of 2008).
</p>

<p>The presumed negative effect of taxation results from a decrease in disposable income that the wealthy claim provides the powerhouse of the economy. The facts are otherwise: the wealthy prefer tax-free, low-risk, government bonds to high-risk innovative start-ups, or even the random fluctuations of the stock market.
</p>

<p>Suppose that as an experiment, the government put a small percent of our taxes into ordinary mutual funds every year, with the income going to Social Security. (3% of the amount could go into high-risk venture that fuel innovation funds, just as now happens.) What has changed? Same investment, no contraction, less money for buying politicians, and it would reduce payroll taxes, which were 10% of the Federal revenue in 1950 and 40% in 2006. Everybody wins! (Corporate taxes &mdash; which are paid by consumers as a concealed sales tax, but appear to be seen by management as governmental theft &mdash; fell from 30% to 10% over the same period.)

</span></a> on liquidity differ not so much in magnitude, as in <i>sign</i>. When such taxes have been tried, it is immediately clear that if there is a way to evade them, it will be used. The ease of moving to another market, or of creating a new (untaxed) instrument, have made local and partial experiments inconclusive. The variety of possible transaction taxes, and the unpredictable responses, leave great uncertainty. One easily understandable <a class="fn">estimate<span>

</span></a> of the income generated by US stock-market transaction taxes ranges from G$177 up.
</p>

<p>Coupled, perhaps with a deliberate delay in transactions, such a tax would hurt no-one except parasites. The transaction tax has other advantages. <a class="fn">Dr. Edgar Feige,<span>
	EL Feige (2001) &lsquo;Taxation for the 21st Century: the automated-payment transaction (APT) tax&rsquo; <cite>Economic Policy</cite><b>15</b>(#31): 473&ndash;511.
</span></a> Professor Emeritus of Economics (University of Wisconsin-Madison), has shown that the astonishingly low rate of 0.6%, applied to 50% of current transactions, could replace <i>all</i> US taxes. Because the rich make more and larger transactions, the tax is <a href="http://www.apttax.com">automatically progressive</a>. State and Federal income would not change, and we would all benefit from a G$200 <a href="http://www.apttax.com/execsummary. php">annual saving</a> in filling out tax forms and <a class="fn">enforcing tax law.<span>
	One example: &lsquo;$50,000 family income deposited and spent or moved to savings results in $100,000 of transactions paying a total tax of $600 distributed over all the individual transactions &hellip;, nowhere near the $15,000&rsquo; paid today.

</p>

<p>This should markedly reduce the number of tax lawyers and stock brokers, but since their pay currently represents a large, if hidden, fraction of market and social inefficiency, their disappearance will compensate the market for an appreciable fraction of the transaction tax. Putting all of those bright and hard-working parasites into socially useful jobs should also do wonders for their self-esteem. Recall Chrysostom&apos;s realization that payment to a lawyer for making the worse appear the better was the <a href="../_B/B06a.shtml#Chr"> wages of Satan</a>. This seems to be a minority opinion in the trade.
</p>

<p>How large the transaction tax would have to be to replace the government&apos;s seigniorage from inflation is not known. However, since we are accustomed to paying a sales tax on anything else we buy, a 3% transaction tax on financial paper would still represent unwarranted special treatment of the financial sector, all in the interest of liquidity. London City bankers have threatened to relocate if an 0.005% microtax were imposed on their transactions {<i>GW</i> 2009-12-18 p1}. Note that when the shoe is on the other foot, these same bankers think that a 3.5% charge for an Automatic Teller transaction is fair &mdash; a 700-fold bias in their favor. Their temper tantrum over 0.005% can be obviated by a governmental refusal to provide deposit insurance and other support to institutions trading offshore, or a simple announcement that such trades would have <a class="fn">no legal standing.<span>

</span></a>
</p>

<p>Yet perhaps the island move has merit: We transport all the bankers, in the British tradition, to a low-lying off-shore tax haven &mdash; <i>and make them stay there</i>. Sea-level rise will do the rest.
</p>

<p>Transaction tax and delays introduce market inefficiencies, but we learned long ago that boilers need controls to prevent explosions, and that internal combustion engines need efficiency-reducing mufflers if we are going to live with them. The largest market inefficiency is white-collar crime, which no banker has ever complained about unless he was the victim. Efficiency is never the <i>primum bonum</i>, but one of several desirable goals. Any physical system is doing well to run at 40% efficiency, so a little friction in the stock market is not particularly important.

<p class="epi">Too much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists, but too few capitalists. &mdash; G.K. Chesterton

<p>The other thing that the market needs is greater equality of ownership. Mutual funds and pension plans turn many financially <a class="fn">naïve and uninterested <span>
	I speak from experience. To my bemused astonishment, TIAA-CREF (the standard professorial retirement fund) turned me (briefly) into a notional millionaire while I wasn&apos;t looking. Driving a bicycle, wearing 2nd-hand clothes, and cheerfully dumpster diving for pet food with a friend (5 cats, 6 dogs, and a dozen chickens between us) in the morning, I noticed in the afternoon mail that between house and retirement fund I was &lsquo;worth&rsquo; M$1.2. (Thanks to inflation, this translates into maybe $120,000 in terms of childhood dollars &mdash; hence the &lsquo;notional&rsquo;.) Still, the magic of capitalism, even in its current grossly deformed form, has made my retirement income greater than my working income, without a single informed* decision on my part. Nice!<br>
	Think what it could do for us all if we fixed it!
<br>-------------------<br>
	* Yes, they sent me 80 pages of jargon &lsquo;explaining&rsquo; the details: &lsquo;PLEASE READ YOUR CONTRACT. IT IS IMPORTANT.&rsquo; Unfortunately, it is impenetrable and conveys no detectable information, altlhough it apparently satisfies &lsquo;the requirements of IRC Section 401(a), 401(k), 403(a), 403(b), 415(m), 457, or any other section &hellip;&rsquo;.
</span></a> people into passive capitalists, sharing in the money-making capacity of American business in a non-speculative way. A perfectly adequate approach is to settle for the average market &mdash; which is the best most mutual funds can do, and it least keeps up with inflation. There is no reason why what are now &lsquo;transfer payments&rsquo; from taxes should not ultimately come from diffuse ownership.
</p>

<p>The question is how to get there gracefully. The groundwork for such a system was laid a century ago by Pope Leo XIII&apos;s encyclical <cite>Rerum Novarum</cite> (1891) and Pope Pius XI&apos;s <cite>Quadragesimo Anno</cite> (1931) leading to the movement known as Distributism, championed by G.K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc. In its British incarnation, it was perhaps too agrarian and yeomanly nostalgic, but what it aspires to is that everyone should become an owner of productive property. Its American expression resulted in the anti-trust legislation that so annoys conservatives, who want to own it all. As noted earlier, Adam Smith&apos;s &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; works better, the more decision makers there are in the economic system, so trust-busting is fundamental to working economics. There is, in fact, good evidence to show that
</p>

<p>Capitalism aims at as few owners as possible; Socialism tries to ensure that the owners are collective entities; and experience shows that neither of these is optimal. Hence the continual interest in a &lsquo;third way&rsquo;. A relatively painless approach might take advantage of existing institutions. The devil is in the
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="New Idea"></a>
details, so I make only a minor suggestion. Perhaps the tax on corporations should be replaced by a tax on unearned income from dividends, interest, and capital gains that is <i>higher</i> than the tax on earned income, and paid in kind &mdash; that is, with financial paper. The goal is not for the government to acquire voting control of companies, because private enterprise seems better at efficiency and innovation. One criterion might be the elimination of working-age rentiers: no employable person should be able to live off of investments alone &mdash; at least not until all can. The earnings from such paper might replace the intentionally regressive FICA tax that now feeds Social Security, which would slowly transform into a mutual fund owned by the accumulated working days of <a class="fn">the public.<span>
	This would naturally result in Social Security being fed the least promising paper, albeit at the current market value, so it should be allowed to trade actively, if conservatively.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>This would gradually reduce inequality by transferring a large fraction of ownership to the population at large, eliminate the (largely imaginary) financial worries of Social Security, and smoothly resolve Warbasse&apos;s Dilemma. (There is no reason why Social Security administrators should be less adroit than other mutual-fund administrators, particularly if the top job were seen as a reward for success elsewhere.)
</p>

<p>At the same time, we might require both elected and appointed officials to convert their commercial paper from specific portfolios to a single, market-average fund as long as they hold office. This would remove the Instinct-1-related incentive to run for office by making it very difficult for them to distribute government largesse to corporations in which they own stock, remove the possibility of insider trading, and focus their attention on the Constitutional goal of &lsquo;promoting the <i>general</i> Welfare&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>A common misperception by conservatives is that unless the lower echelons are desperate they will not work. In the absence of simple jobs now done by machines, it is probably cost effective to pay the least competent 12% (a fraction suggested by the stable fraction of &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; in <a href="../_B/B05.shtml#F5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>) to stay home and watch TV.
</p>

<p>Just as the Japanese have created compute-generate-imagery (CGI) pop singers and boy bands, we could create as many CGI sports leagues as required to keep the 12% entranced, with on-line betting and complete backstories (e.g.: college quarterbacks and draft picks). NASA is working on 3D printing of meals for space travel (&lsquo;The 3D printing component will deliver macronutrients (starch, protein, and fat), structure, and texture while the ink jet will deliver micronutrients, flavor, and odor.&rsquo; says the <a  class="fn" href="http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/12/sbir/phase1/SBIR-12-1-H12.04-9357.html?solicitationId=SBIR_12_P1">proposal,<span>
	The proposal goes on to talk about feeding 12 billion people, sounding more and more like <cite>Soylent Green</cite>. [Click for more.]
</span></a> so ultimately, the TV could deliver hot dogs, beer, and pizza.
</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that most people I have known keep productively busy whether they are being paid or not. They tend to recognize 2 fiscal situations: either there is enough money, and they do something interesting; or there isn&apos;t, and they do whatever is necessary. This is an attitude that can be encouraged by removing the constant commercial pressure for mindless consumption.
</p>

<p>CEO-types also want us to think that they will not work &mdash; and the economy will collapse &mdash; unless they themselves are lavishly overpaid. We should call their bluff and let them join the ranks of the TV watchers. The country would run better.
</p>

<p>Utopian experiments consistently fail, but how much of this is caused by pressure from the outside world? What would happen if we sank the consumerist society, let the employees of advertizing agencies write pulp fiction, and in the proven manner of egalitarian hunter-gatherers, publicly guillotined anyone who preached &lsquo;greed is good&rsquo;? See <a href="#18">Mondragón</a> for an eminently practical answer to this question.

<p>The law that requires the Board of Directors to consider only the welfare of the stockholders was written by stockholders; a law written by disinterested people might well require a broader view. &lsquo;Evidence shows that a company focused on shareholder value actually performs worse for its shareholders in the long run&rsquo; {<i>GW</i> editorial, 2009-09-18 p22}. It took me a while to find the original source for that editorial, because US business analysts maintain stoutly that a company can maximize only one thing, and that one thing should be dividends &mdash; but this is a parochial view.

<p>Table 23.2 sets the background for the <cite>Guardian&apos;s</cite> statement. The return from buy-and-hold investing (with reinvestment of dividends from 1972 to 2006) was: GM 5%, Ford 18%, the S&P index 36% &mdash; and Toyota 125%. In short, stakeholder-first companies can do 25 times better than stockholder-first. We really should rethink our love affair with gangster capitalism!

<p>As <a href="#F23.4">Fig. 23.4</a> indicates, as long as elections depend upon finances, the rich will be elected, and they will legislate for the benefit of the rich. A possible way to guarantee a sincere legislative interest in eliminating poverty would fix legislative pay as some small multiple of the mean income of the 1st pentile (the lowest 20%). We would see an immediate rise in the 1st pentile&apos;s income, the general welfare, and statistical lying.

<p>That 25% of small-scale societies resort to negative selection raises questions about the others. Some may have succeeded in removing the offending alleles from their gene pool, so that they no longer need this approach. Some use potlatch, in which social standing depends upon redistributing excess wealth.

</p>

<p>The Levitical Jubilee Year {Lev 25:11 ff} is another attempt to correct the accumulations of greed, but it introduced sharp social discontinuities by freeing slaves and returning land to its original owner every 50 years. This is hardly practical in modern society.
</p>

<p>A number of our rich people seem to have enjoyed building fortunes, losing them, and starting over. For them, the enforced potlatch of the Levitical Sabbath-year approach seems reasonable: Every 7th year they would return their surplus to the commons (via the tax man) and start the game over. They could count coup by the amount they collected instead of the amount they kept. Administered with intelligence and good humor &mdash; admittedly, something of a challenge for either burocrat or plutocrat &mdash; this should keep the overly acquisitive entertained while doing no irremediable harm to the oikos they are robbing.

<p>Getting rid of the Federal Reserve System is felt, in some circles, to be a dangerous and crackpot idea. It is not. As usual, I defer to the careful research of others. After nearly 600 pages of research that justifies his conclusions, <a class="fn">G. Edward Griffin<span>
	GE Griffin (2009) <cite>The Creature from Jekyll Island: a Second Look at the Federal Reserve</cite> 4th ed. (American Media, California).
</span></a> summarizes 7 reasons for getting rid of the Fed, with explanations in brackets:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It is incapable of achieving its stated objectives [because they are not its real goals];</li>

<li>It is a cartel operated for its owners (private banks) and against the public interest [necessitating the 2-income family];</li>

<li>It is the supreme instrument of usury;</li>

<li>It generates our most unfair tax [inflation];</li>

<li>It encourages war [which requires government borrowing, creating bank profits];</li>

<li>It destabilizes the economy [profiting by oscillation between easy and tight money, rather than stability];</li>

<li>It is an instrument of totalitarianism [banker David Rockefeller seems to divide the world into parasites (bankers), their hosts (depositors and borrowers), and those who contribute nothing to his welfare because they neither deposit nor borrow money (ie, &lsquo;superfluous eaters&rsquo;)].</li>
</ol>


<p>Although Griffin does not discuss gross inequality as a social menace, he does present a program for thwarting the feudal ambitions of the oligarchs, which is a giant step in the right direction. Admitting that &lsquo;There is no optimistic scenario&rsquo; for the foreseeable future, he suggests that something better is possible than his &lsquo;pessimistic scenario&rsquo; &mdash; which established his credentials as financial prognosticator: In 1994 he predicted the bank crisis, the bailout, and the <a class="fn">continuing inflation.<span>
	Perhaps I am overly sensitive to this last. As I financed my experimental autonomous house with $9900 transfers from my US bank, their value in euros fell from €14,000 to €7500. The renminbi is now accepted in world trade, and China&apos;s persistent purchase of both gold and dollar debt suggest a desire to replace the dollar as the reserve currency.
 It may be possible to avoid the remainder of his predictions (which you will like even less) &mdash; but not if we just sit by and watch. Check <a href="http://www.freedom-force.org">freedom-force.org</a>.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Getting rid of the Fed&rsquo; implies making Congress again responsible for controlling the money supply &mdash; not by the present mode of asking the Fed to increase it, but with pay-as-we-go, inflation-free, taxation. This reduces the amount of pork available; the necessary fair (ie, ferociously progressive) income tax infuriates feudalists; none of us will like paying for wars; none will want to pay for the CIA&apos;s black (fascist) operations for the benefit of US corporations. These are all benefits of an honest money system.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s&rsquo; {Matt 22:21} has usually been understood as an injunction to the church not to meddle with secular or financial power. Caesar&apos;s coins were at least honest money, as the practice of marking coins as worth more than their intrinsic value had not been invented. Historically, inflation has been an indication of a dishonest money system, so the fractional-reserve system would seem to be a legitimate target of ecclesiastical ire. (Recall Jesus, the bankers, and the <a href="../_E/E19.shtml#58">bull whip</a>).

<p>However, zero inflation also means that every time someone gets a raise, someone else gets a balancing loss. This is not a pleasant expectation, making a modest degree of inflation useful to allow readjustments of relative income without reducing PPP, the Purchasing Power Parity of the dollar. Annual overall inflation of 4.606%, for instance, leads to a factor of 100 pay raise over a century &mdash; at which time the currency is simply devalued by a factor of 100 and the process repeated. If bank balances are also <a class="fn">adjusted uniformly<span>
	Granted, the acceptability of this idea requires that the general population possess unusual mathematical sophistication, including the ability to multiply.
</span></a> by the same percent, accumulated purchasing power does not change during this process. All that happens is that some individuals receive more, and some less, than the average annual increase, just as now. PPP, the most honest evaluation of the value of a currency, remains <a class="fn">unchanged.<span>
	Something similar happens automatically if sufficient information is available. When I worked in the aerospace industry in San Diego, and the unions at Convair (the largest local employer) negotiated a raise, everyone in town followed suit &mdash; and rent and grocery prices rose in concert.
</span></a>

<p>Traditionally, the value of labor has increased with time because investment in newer machinery made labor more productive. The capitalistic investor claims this increase as his own, because he made the investment. This is specious: he bought the machinery with surplus-value expropriated from his workers. Logically and ethically, they should share in the increased time-value of their work. (In general, this has not happened in the US since the late 1960s.)
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Inflation-free&rsquo; also means that the per-capita money supply does not change, but is adjusted as the population changes. (This implies that every newborn receives a &lsquo;free gift&rsquo; of <i>Ṁ</i>, the mean share of national wealth, no doubt distributed over her childhood years, while every death returns <i>Ṁ</i> to the Treasury. Society currently does not control <i>Ṁ</i> (which includes money created by private banks via fractional-reserve banking) making
<p>

<br><hr>

Note that we do <b>not</b> need the Fed to organize this: the Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget are perfectly competent to handle it, eliminating the middle-man, the interest payments, the concept of national debt, and the steady drain on society caused by the accumulation of money by the banksters who own the Fed. It, with those who die broke balanced by adjusting the income tax. The accuracy of estimates is not critical here: small errors in one year can be corrected in the following year.
</p>

<p>This creates a zero-sum society, but does not address intentional inequality in distribution, which is another question entirely. In addition, we are all so enamored of the concept of &lsquo;more&rsquo; that we willingly accept inflation and its illusion of improvement in the numbers. It might be politically expedient to let <i>Ṁ</i> grow by 1&ndash;3% annually, with its attendant 1&ndash;3% annual loss of value to our savings and increase in prices. This is not all bad: it gives Congress a dependable 1&ndash;3% slush fund for pork barrels and black ops.
</p>

<p>The fatal flaw in this approach is that the balancing return of <i>Ṁ</i> for every death requires the destruction of that money, rather than its recirculation, and this in turn requires currently unachievable honesty in government. (Similar destruction is &lsquo;required&rsquo; of payments on any bank loan. Did your banker ever explain how that works?) We have not addressed many annoying details, such as paying for MIC-wars, but these too are separate questions.

</p>

<p>One has to question the ham-handed manner in which we chose to handle the crisis of 2008. The problem, in a nutshell, was that freshly deregulated banks wittingly made uncollectable loans at excessive interest to unqualified borrowers in aid of immediate paper profits, and sold the debt in derivative packages which concealed the shaky underpinning. (The purchasers assumed that they were buying the steady repayment of the debt plus interest: the cost of the package, and the predicted return are adjusted to make this appeal to financial types.) A small recession then produced a large number of defaults, because the households involved did not have any reserves &mdash; and the banks cried panic. We covered the banks&rsquo; losses; they paid the people who planned the process their customary exorbitant bonuses, repossessed the houses, resold some for next to nothing, left some derelict, and rented others until the market recovered enough to make the sales profitable.

<p>Here was a made-to-order opportunity to reimpose the Glass-Steagall regulations that help bankers stay honest against their every instinct.

	According to Paul Krugman {<cite>NY Times</cite> 2014-05-19}, failure to do this was largely the work of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and &lsquo;he was &hellip; all for bailing out banks but against bailing out families&rsquo;. Since it would have cost no more to bail out both at once, the decision to evict the people was both nasty and stupid &mdash; or, in a word, the epitome of feudofascism.

It has evolved into some 200 cooperatives encompassing agriculture, industry, education, banking, housing, retail distribution, and &lsquo;service&rsquo; &mdash; the last a category which replaces a number of functions normally performed by government burocracies.

<p>The principles of Table 23.4 are remarkably similar to those of Warbasse&apos;s <cite>Cooperative Democracy</cite>, published a few years before the first Mondragón cooperative venture. A comparative historical analysis would be of
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
considerable interest: was this diffusion or independent invention? There is also some indication that cooperation is a survival of traditional peasant values. Although genetics shows little difference between Basques and their <a class="fn">neighbors,<span>
	This is misleading, because the genetic analysis focussed on phenotypic determinants that are easily picked up from a surrounding population. Full genome analysis will be more informative.
</span></a> the Basque language, Euskara, is a linguistic isolate that may go back to Paleolithic days. The Euskara word for &lsquo;axe&rsquo;, <i>aizkora</i>, is derived from <i>aitz</i>, &lsquo;stone&rsquo;; perhaps other culturally transmitted traits (like the cooperative urge) also survive from the days when we first discovered that cooperation was an improvement over killing.

</span></a> form local organizations (some as small as 3 beekeepers). Although none mention &lsquo;cooperation&rsquo;, these appear to represent a similar evolution toward a functional alternative to both gangster capitalism and socialist bigbrotherhood. Judging by the basically &lsquo;peasant&rsquo; orientation of the French groups, few will have heard of Warbasse or Mondragón. Unlike the Mondragón practice of fostering new co-ops, their only interaction is a Département-wide directory of associations. Still, there are associations dedicated to instituting the transaction tax, so they are not naïve about economics. Citizen action from below seems to be an intelligent and successful way to regenerate the organs of civil society, and the &lsquo;Mondragón Principles&rsquo; &mdash; not that different from the rules of early Christian communities &mdash; offer a viable example.
</p>

<p> The Spanish Catholic Church instinctively sided with the nobles and fascists. The cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, in the center of Basque territory and a pilgrimage site since medieval days, is a baroque treasure house that reveals imperial indifference to the welfare of the surrounding people. Religion had so little influence on Mondragón that the term is not even indexed in Morrison&apos;s book. Yet Mondragón is exactly the sort of venture that churches should be instituting, in the manner of the Apostles.

</p>

<blockquote>The creation of a <i>solari</i>, a local knowledge manager/databank that publishes neighborhood financial statements and information and tracks the Solari Index in your place, can make it possible for your neighborhood to create a mutual fund that could channel capital to the profitable small businesses in your neighborhood so that participating small-business income could start to trade at a multiple of 10 times &mdash; even 20 times or 30 times eventually. The potential capital gains are in the trillions of dollars.

<p class="epi">If you spend four hours a day on the phone dialing for dollars &mdash; which is certainly not uncommon around [Washington], Democrat or Republican &mdash; the people you&apos;re going to dial have a lot of money. &mdash; Independent Senator Bernie Sanders
</p>

<p>If you spend half of your working day scrounging money from the parasite class, you are probably not going to spend the rest of it working against them. With 2 or 3 exceptions, the Supreme Court is probably smart enough to understand this, yet they voted to encourage it. This is a SCAD (State Crime Against Democracy), and grounds for terminating their employment, if not locking them up.
</p>

<p>To encourage politicians to work for the <i>general</i> welfare (instead of their own), their stockmarket holdings should be in a blind trust during their term of office. Their individual choices should be replaced by offerings of equivalent value, from a pool of green, sustainable, and local-government offerings, with the proviso that at the end of their term, the value returned will not be less than the current market equivalent of their initial worth. Such pools, containing hundreds of companies, are already offered by most large mutual funds; all that is required is that individual politicians not know which companies are in their packages.
</p>

<p>This ensures that they do not vote for wars because they hold stock in war industries, that they do not vote subsidies to companies they own stock in, and that they have a direct financial interest in the success of Gaian enterprises.
</p>

<p>Anyone who runs for office for personal profit will be mortally offended by such a procedure &mdash; which is the point. We don&apos;t want people like that in government, and we are happy to let them filter themselves out.

<p class="epi">[M]any of the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar &hellip; make it their special task to work out bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients, individual or corporate, can evade the laws which were made to regulate, in the interests of the public, the uses of great wealth. &mdash; Teddy Roosevelt
</p>

<p>Need an example of the epigraph? Tom DeLay, former House Majority Leader, was convicted of laundering $190,000 of corporate money through his <a class="fn">political action committee.<span>
	He was convicted in January 2011 and sentenced to three years in prison, but had his conviction overturned by a friendly appeals court. In June 2014, prosecutors asked the Supreme Court of Texas to reinstate his conviction, but lost the appeal in October 2014.
</span></a. His attorney, Brian Wice, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tom-delay-texas-conviction-20121010,0,4889750.story">maintained</a> that he was innocent because the laundered article was not cash, but a check. Technically, this is correct: the law in question was amended after the fact to include checks. The <i>intent</i> of the law &mdash; obvious to any ethical observer &mdash; was to minimize the political influence of corporations (independent of the physical format of the corrupting money) and one expects judges to base their decision on intent. With 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat on the Appeal bench, Wice claimed he had expected a 2:1 partisan verdict in his favor &mdash; as clear an admission of expected corruption as one could ask.
</p>

<p>A lawyer interested in justice might feel obliged to work toward the intent of the law rather than its evasion. Could this be made an enforceable prerequisite of membership in the bar? (Or is this a misunderstanding of the profession?) In the nature of things, not all laws are good, and the bad ones must be challenged. While bad laws are not universally recognizable (some think the &lsquo;Patriot&rsquo; Act beneficial), evasion of a good law is easier to spot.
</p>

<p>The &lsquo;highly remunerated&rsquo; aspect of law evasion is a major problem. The US early aspired to equality before the law. While this sounds easy, we have never achieved it, because the minimum precondition for this is &lsquo;equal arms&rsquo;, meaning that both sides have the <a class="fn">same resources<span>
	The internet search for &lsquo;equal arms&rsquo; was a rare failure. It turned up only 5000 hits, equally divided among starfish, crosses, branches of government, and books by law professors. This is clearly not a hot topic on the web. Most of the accessible material was written by lawyers whose first language was not English, suggesting that the vaunted Anglo-Saxon tradition is not doing its job in our law schools.
</span></a> to present their case. Equal arms do not yet exist anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p>Law is stacked in favor of the rich &mdash; which is the way rich defendants (and law firms) want it. It is not just the high cost of legal representation that frustrates equality before the law, but procedures and rules protecting corporate profit, including
</p>

<blockquote>the difficulty of calculating damages, imperfect substantive liability rules, restrictions on class actions, dilatory practices of defendant corporations, &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; prohibitions against lawyers informing consumers of their right to sue, similar rules against lawyers financing and purchasing consumer causes of action. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	Mark Green &amp; Beverly Moore.<span> 890 <cite>Yale Law Journal</cite><b> 82</b> (1983).
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This situation is <i>not</i> in the public interest, and it is not what the framers of the Constitution hoped to achieve.
</p>

<p id="21a"><b>The most obvious abuse of unequal arms is the SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation</b>,
</p>

<blockquote>intended to intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.

The plaintiff&apos;s goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, <b>mounting legal costs</b> or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. &mdash; {Wikipedia} [Emphasis added.]
</blockquote>

<p>Only 26 US states have anti-SLAPP legislation; the &lsquo;red states&rsquo; predictably lag behind. The most satisfying anti-SLAPP case was the finding by the European Court of Human Rights that the defendants in the McLibel case had not received a <a class="fn">fair trial<span>

<p class="epi">The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law in the minds of all right thinking people. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	David Pannick QC<span> <cite>London Times</cite> 1999-04-24.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>In 1988, the defendants, members of London Greenpeace (not the better-known Greenpeace International) drew together criticisms of McDonald&apos;s by specialist groups &mdash; animal rights, nutritionists, unions, environmentalists, child psychologists, &c &mdash; and distributed a 1-page pamphlet entitled &lsquo;What&apos;s wrong with McDonald&apos;s: Everything they don&apos;t want you to know&rsquo; to a few hundred people, noting in short paragraphs that McDonald&apos;s Restaurants:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Buys from greedy rulers and elites and practices economic imperialism;</li>

<li>Is complicit in Third World starvation;</li>

 <li>Destroys rain forests with poisons and colonial invasions;</li>

<li>Sells unhealthy, addictive junk food;</li>

<li>Alters its food with artificial chemistry;</li>

<li>Poisons customers with contaminated meat;</li>

<li>Wastes vast quantities of grain and water;</li>

<li>Is responsible for torture and murder (of animals);</li>

<li>Exploits children with its advertising;</li>

<li>Exploits its workers and bans unions; and</li>

<li>Hides its malfeasance.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the US, this pamphlet would have been Constitutionally protected free speech. McDonald&apos;s, a US company caring as little for the Constitution as for anything but profits, had successfully used Britain&apos;s antediluvian libel law &mdash; beloved of the House of Lords because it requires the defendant to prove all statements challenged by the plaintiff, where US law rationally requires the plaintiff to demonstrate damage &mdash; to intimidate more than 90 news media into ritual groveling, apology, and retraction of factual articles. Even BBC and the <cite>Guardian</cite> &mdash; of whom one expects better &mdash; had knuckled under in abject cowardice.
</p>

<p>McDonald&apos;s first hired spies to infiltrate London Greenpeace &mdash; with the result that there were sometimes as many spies as campaigners at the meetings. In 1990, they sued London Greenpeace members for libel. &lsquo;The McLibel Two&rsquo;, Helen Steel, gardener, and David Morris, postal clerk, elected to fight. Libel cases are denied more than 2 hours of legal aid &mdash; &lsquo;You can&apos;t win!&rsquo; &mdash; , so they represented themselves, against a legal team headed by Richard Rampton, a £2000/day Queen&apos;s Counsel libel specialist. The attitude of the judge (with a contemptuous opinion of British citizens: &lsquo;The issues are too complex to be understood by a jury&rsquo;), was the one commonly expressed by lawyers: &lsquo;The person who represents himself has a fool for a client&rsquo;. Keir Starmer, a barrister appalled by the <a class="fn">imbalance of the case,<span>
	One is entitled to wonder why QC Rampton and Judge Rodger Bell were not similarly embarrassed. This appears to reflect constitutive defects in the education of lawyers, the make-up of the bar exam, the appointment of judges, and the concept of due process itself.
</span></a> volunteered pro bono help. An eventual 180 witnesses supported the claims against McDonald&apos;s, many flying to Britain on their own money.
</p>

<p>After a year, McDonald&apos;s offered to settle out of court, with a donation to any charity the defendants suggested, provided Steel and Morris stopped criticizing McDonald&apos;s in public. Steel and Morris accepted the terms, properly adding the conditions that McDonald&apos;s apologize to everyone they had sued in the past, promise not to sue people in the future, and limit their advertizing to recommendations in private conversation. An interesting aspect of the meeting was that the executives described themselves as &lsquo;principled&rsquo;. Just as any action can be called &lsquo;rational&rsquo;, given the appropriate axioms, any behavior be called righteous, given the appropriate principles. Evidently the corporate principle is: Consumers are just that and no more; real people wear suits.
</p>

<p>The turning point was the website <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/story.html">www.McSpotlight.org</a>, which &mdash; with a million hits in the first month &mdash; made available to the public the information gathered by Steel and Morris and ignored by advertizing-dependent commercial media.
</p>

<p>The average American child&apos;s nutritional education is 20,000 ads for junk food per year &mdash; foods which are directly linked to obesity, and indirectly to heart disease and cancers. McDonald&apos;s not only exploits children, it devotes G$1.8/year to brainwashing them for the sake of &lsquo;pester power&rsquo; and a life-long addiction to junk food. In the witness box, McDonald&apos;s executives defence was to claim adherence to all existing laws and regulations, so the place to begin repair is by criminalizing corporate lobbying.
</p>

<p>The 100-to-1 financial imbalance &mdash; &rsquo;several million pounds&rsquo; by McDonald&apos;s, £35,000 by the defendants, all from public support &mdash; and bad law eventually took their toll. In 1997, the judge wrote an 800-page decision (with a 45-page summary read in court) primarily favoring McDonald&apos;s &mdash; while admitting that they:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>endangered the health of their workers and customers by &lsquo;misleading advertizing&rsquo;</b>,</li>

<li><b>&lsquo;exploit children&rsquo;</b>,</li>

<li><b>were &lsquo;culpably responsible&rsquo; in the infliction of unnecessary cruelty to animals</b>, and</li>

<li><b>were antagonistic to unions and paid their workers low wages.</b></li>
</ul>


<p>The Law Lords predictably rejected an appeal, so the case went to the European Court of Human Rights, where Steel and Morris had free legal representation, and which ruled on 15 February 2005 that British libel law breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. I would have awarded them £2000/day for the 313-day duration of the original case. Each. After all, Rampton was paid that much for masterminding &lsquo;the worst corporate PR disaster in history&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Governor of California, signed a law that lets state courts ignore British libel judgements, in order &lsquo;to place greater protection on freedom of speech&rsquo; {<i>GW</i> 2009-10-23 p2}. Parliament might find this terribly embarrassing. As should McDonald&apos;s.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ultimate concerns&rsquo;: if the manipulation of children, the life expectancy of adults, the exploitation of workers, and the destruction of ecosystems are not &lsquo;ultimate concerns&rsquo;, what are? The clergy, church-goers, and atheists of England should have been outside the courthouses every day of the trials, demanding that the court recognize that ultimate concerns have a higher ethical priority than concealment of corporate chicanery.
</p>

<p>The ironic postscript to McLibel is that it now appears almost certain that McDonald&apos;s-type food is a causative factor in <a class="fn">Alzheimer&apos;s disease<span>S Akterin (2008) &lsquo;From cholesterol to oxidative stress in Alzheimer&apos;s disease: A wide perspective on a multifactorial disease&lrsquo; (PhD thesis, Karolinska Institutet).</span></a> The chain appears to go junk food &mdash; high-fructose <a class="fn">corn syrup<span>
	Sugars have the common formula (HCOH)<sub>n</sub>. Sucrose (common sugar) is a disaccharide of glucose (n=6, blood sugar) plus fructose (n=5). Blood sugar is normally closely controlled by insulin, with varying amounts admitted to various organs, so that an adequate level of sucrose turns off the hunger response. Fructose is not so monitored, and an excessive level does not turn off hunger, but is converted to body fat.<br>
	Fructose is cheaply made from corn starch, so it is popular for sweetening junk food. Hence the direct connection between junk-food and obesity. The connection to brain damage is more subtle.<br>
</span></a>

 &mdash; excess blood sugar &mdash; loss of insulin control &mdash; brain damage. Some researchers are now calling Alzheimer&apos;s &lsquo;type 3 diabetes&rsquo;. In short, item 4 in the Greenpeace list is accurate.

<p>The importance of education, its current failings, and the need to improve it, are underlying currents in anything written by a college professor, so this section can be short.
</p>

<p>If a culture is interested in its own survival, or in increasing its own welfare, or in the evolutionary requirement of leaving a better world for its children, its first priority is educating those children. In 2014, Germany shamed the rest of the Western world by making university education free to all (including foreigners). The pay-back time for such a decision being longer than 90 days, the US has not thought of this, preferring to limit education to the wealthy, or failing that, to burden students with enough debt so that their every decision is made at the behest of creditors. (Cynically, one might imagine that Germany is not being progressive and altruistic, but is simply making an <a class="fn">inexpensive<span>
	Universities cost less than bombers these days.
</span></a> bid to dominate the world in the next century.)
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Crowd-sourced&rsquo; education seems to be a promising approach that by its inherent diversity can avoid bias. Given one thing only &mdash; the ability to discard nonsense &mdash; the web has the potential to take a 4-yr old through college. Non-profit web sites such as the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a>, Wikipedia, the MIT/Harvard <a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">edx</a>, and <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, offer dependable, bias-free, open-source education to anyone. With a bit of organization into formal courses, these have the ability to bring professional expertise into home education. Or, for that matter, into any school district. Equally, the web has the same power to distort education that Fox brings to commentary and main-stream media to news; it&apos;s a 2-edged sword.
</p>

<p>This is education in its infancy. <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/04/22/tech-fueled-inequality-offers-two-paths-for-humanity-digital-athens-or-bleak-dystopia/">Erik Brynjolfsson&apos;s</a> vision of &lsquo;digital Athens&rsquo; sees a recrudescence of a society with the leisure to pursue good government, learning, science, humanities, the arts &mdash; and home schooling. Upgrade the prototype with some insights from 2500 years of experience:
</p>

<ul class="o3">
<li>Slavery degrades the masters;</li>

<li>Biology is not destiny;</li>

<li>Revealed religion is arbitrary;</li>

<li>Meaningful work,</li>

<li>and reflective leisure are human rights;</li>

<li>Secrecy corrupts;</li>

<li>Equality benefits;</li>

<li>Greed corrodes;</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">add instant access to the world&apos;s libraries, and the ability to search them in detail &mdash; and who knows: we might be able to make it all work.
</p>

<p>This still omits perhaps the most important component of effective education, which is the guidance of a good teacher and the interaction with a conversational group of peers that typify the classical small liberal-arts college. A good teacher can reformulate the meandering question of a confused student in coherent terms so that he and the class can see both the cause of his confusion and its <a class="fn">resolution.<span>
	I watched Herbert Marcuse do this (at a time when conservative groups were trying to get him thrown off campus because his version of Modern European History did not sit well with their conviction of American Exceptionalism). Despite my best efforts I never equalled his skill.
</span></a> Bull sessions with peers probably do more to sort out adolescent perplexities than teachers or parents together. These needs are only marginally addressed by on-line courses that have an accompanying blog. There are experiments to be done here.
<p>

<p>In the meantime, about &lsquo;greed corroding&rsquo; &hellip;

</p>

<p>Except that we don&apos;t. The Justice Department failed to prosecute JPMorgan Chase despite the facts that (as whistleblower Alayne Fleischmann reported), &lsquo;the proof is easily there for all the elements of the crime as defined by federal law &mdash; the bank made material misrepresentations, it made material omissions, and it did so willfully and with specific intent, consciously ignoring warnings from inside the firm and out&rsquo;.

</blockquote>Responsibility remains so diffuse, and top executives so insulated, that any misconduct could again be considered more a symptom of the institution's culture than a result of the willful actions of any single individual.
</blockquote>

<p>A perfect example of the corporate mindset is provided by the private military force Blackwater. When Daniel Carroll, Blackwater&apos;s project manager in Iraq, was under investigation by the State Department for the profligate murder of civilians, he explained to the Department&apos;s (female) investigator that:
</p>

<blockquote>he could kill me at that very moment and no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq. &hellip; Mr. Carroll&apos;s statement was made in a low, even tone of voice, his head was slightly lowered; his eyes were fixed on mine. I took Mr. Carroll&apos;s threat seriously. We were in a combat zone where things can happen quite unexpectedly, especially when issues involve potentially negative impacts on a lucrative security contract. &mdash; <a href=”http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2014/06/30-0">Jean C. Richter, State Dept. investigator.</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Blackwater also provides an insight into the endemic corruption of the Military-Industrial-Congressional clique. The Congressional war-mongers include Tea Party members whose raison d&apos;etre seems to be eliminating taxes by making government irrelevant. Yet they allow the use of private mercenaries at 10 times the cost of Army personnel, with neither accountability nor the Army&apos;s oath-bound acceptance of civilian oversight. <i>Cui bono?</i>
</p>

<p>Another excuse for the economic problems of 2008 is that the generation that remembered the Depression of the 1930s had all retired. The financial system itself &mdash; with its firm belief that &lsquo;long term is tomorrow morning&rsquo; &mdash; has no memory at all. Therefore its memory must come from outside, in the form of government regulation (despite the whining, blustering and indignant theoretical papers that this will generate). Free-market theorists will explain that regulation causes friction and inefficiency in what should be a perfect market; the counter-argument is that you don&apos;t let children play with hand grenades no matter how efficiently they play. Make the rules while we are still sufferlng from the unregulated behavior, and then <b>do not change them</b> simply to facilitate the next generation of <a class="fn">Ponzi schemes.<span>
	A Ponzi scheme promises high return on investment, demonstrating this by paying the interest to early investors from the capital coming in later. This may even be legal: the California Real-Estate Investment Trust (CREIT) admitted that each payment came &lsquo;from an undetermined mix of interest and return of capital&rsquo;; my naïveté, the fact that it was run by Professors of Business Administration in my own university, and the knowledge that academics in <i>my</i> field (&lsquo;hard&rsquo; science) would be caught out by the facts if they were not intellectually honest, blinded me to the obvious: Ethics is not part of an MBA&apos;s education because it reduces profit, and is <i>ipso facto</i> irrelevant, if not downright evil. Live and learn: shares bought at $20 were worth $3 when I finally realized what was going on and bailed out.

<p class="epi">[I]nvestors may challenge, in an international arbitration process, any change in law and policy to protect the environment and public health, to promote social or cultural goals, or to grapple with financial or economic crises. &mdash; Isolda Agnazzi of Common Dreams
</p>

<p>Beginning, perhaps with Wilson&apos;s &lsquo;open treaties, openly arrived at&rsquo;, Western governments have slowly been forced, kicking and screaming, toward transparancy. Yet there is far to go!
</p>

<p>A perfect example of this need is a World Bank subsidiary, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established to arbitrate cases brought under international Bilateral (or lately, Multilateral) Investment Treaties such as NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and the Trade In Services Agreement (TISA). Such treaties are designed to remove investment risk, &lsquo;develop market-oriented policies in partner countries, and to promote US exports&rsquo;. (Note that NAFTA has <a class="fn">not reduced<span>
	BA Blonigen (2005) <cite>World Bank Economic Review</cite> <b>19</b>(#3): 407&ndash;424.
</span></a> trade disputes, one of its ostensible goals). The model US BIT provides investors with six core benefits that seem harmless and fair:
</p>


<ol>
<li>All investors be treated even-handedly;</li>
<li>Expropriation is limited;</li>
<li>Fund transfers are expedited;</li>
<li>Performance requirements (e.g., export quotas) are restricted;</li>
<li>Free choice of management is allowed;</li>
<li>Arbitration is provided for.</li>
</ol>


<p>Such matters could obviously be negotiated openly, and since they are legitimate and would not need lobbying and campaign contributions or other input from business. The real purpose, and practice, is very different from the image, because the international fascist treaty takes precedence over national citizen-oriented laws. The right to sue is asymmetrical, possessed by corporations but not by mere governments.
</p>

<p>What sort of cases do BITs consider? The Swedish company Vattenfall claims that its purpose is to &lsquo;create a strong and diversified European energy portfolio with sustainable and increased profits&rsquo;. Noble words &mdash; but in practice it threatened to sue Germany for its post-Fukushima decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Chevron, complaining about Ecuador&apos;s attempts to protect the Amazon from pollution, collected a M$78 fine from Ecuador because its business was &lsquo;negatively affected&rsquo;. It was <i>supposed</i> to be: How else can corporations learn?
</p>

<p>The rules of the ICSID require only that the arbitrators have &lsquo;recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance&rsquo; &mdash; and therein lies the fundamental evil. This ensures a 17th-century&apos;s passion for colonies, exploitation, and profit, demanding an education and mind-set of its judges that is 400 years out of date. There is no requirement for competence in, or awareness of:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>18th-century</b> Enlightenment ideas about government for the benefit of the governed; or</li>

<li><b>19th-century</b> Darwinian discoveries that we were not created expressly to subdue the world; or</li>

<li><b>20th-century</b> scientific concerns about the vulnerability of our environmental life-support systems; or the budding</li>

<li><b>21st-century</b> &lsquo;Occupy&rsquo; recognition that corporate law is inherently sociopathic.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would not surprise me if such awareness were in practice disqualifying.
</p>

<p>I stumbled upon ICSID accidentally. How much such fascist influence lurks in the corridors of burocracy, quietly undoing the apparent gains of progressive legislation?

<p class="epi">[M]ost of TPP is about letting multinational corporations rig the rules on everything from patent protection to food safety standards &mdash; all to benefit themselves. &mdash; <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/02/03/countries-line-sign-toxic-deal-warren-leads-call-reject-tpp">Senator Elizabeth Warren</a>

<p>Alpha males want sex, power, and money. A comprehensive answer of what this translates to in corporate terms is given by TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (&lsquo;NAFTA On Steroids&rsquo;), a potential treaty for the benefit of corporations and destruction of citizen&apos;s rights in Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the US, which has been under secret negotiation since 2007. For a government afraid to join the International Criminal Court lest it come after our politicians for war crimes, ours is curiously anxious to join the TPP, which will empower corporations to take
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14">
	<img class="im" src="../Images/K-Stop3.gif" alt="Stop"></a>
nations to court and overturn sovereign laws if they interfere with profit: taxation, environmental protection, labor, health, safety, Social Security, elections, whatever.
</p>

<p>In keeping with the earlier suggestion that the feudofascists think that they have laid sufficient groundwork to complete their program, it turns out that the TPP is only part of the projectm. Two similar treaties, the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP), and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are just a secret and just as nasty. All 3 are crafted by simple-minded people who recognize only one virtue, only one goal, and only one ethical guide: <b>Make Money</b>.
</p>

<p>In detail, this would mean:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The primary objective is the welfare of the 1&permil;, with uniform fascist pro-business, anti-public-interest, laws.</li>

<li>Sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals.</li>

<li>No reciprocal right exists: governments cannot challenge corporations chartered in other countries.</li>

<li>TPP will allow corporations to outsource jobs to countries with the lowest labor costs and least employee protection.</li>

<li>TPP rules will trump national laws that interfere with &lsquo;market-oriented policies&rsquo;, including:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Labor laws,</li>

	<li>Human rights,</li>

	<li>Health insurance,</li>

	<li>Environmental protection,
</li>
	<li>Bank regulation,</li>

	<li>Food Safety Standards. Recall Monsanto&apos;s business plan of patenting 90% of the world&apos;s food supply.</li>
	</ul>

<li>TPP will introduce laws that we have been fighting to avoid, including:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Feudofascist control of the internet (by any of a number of approaches that have been proposed and rejected by strong public opposition).</li>

	<li>Prevent the break up of too-big-to-fail financial firms, making them <i>legally</i> too big to fail.</li>

	</ul>
<li>Buy America laws could come to an end.</li>

<li>Prescription drug prices will increase, access to life saving drugs will decrease, and the profits of drug companies will go up.</li>


<li>The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.</li>

<li>Enrichment of drug companies at the expense of human health.</li>

<li>Banning some generic drugs.</li>

</ul>

<p>In toto this list amounts to an atrocious betrayal of society by the people we choose to govern it. The mindset revealed here is that of the psychopath, unable to see beyond his own (stockmarket) welfare, and too arrogant to credit the advice of experts aware of dangers he lacks the skills to recognize. It is obvious that such a mindset will seek political power; less obvious is why we cannot collectively recognize the threat they pose.
</p>

<p>The above is not enough. Financial institutions have bought companies positioned to bring ISID cases that look profitable, and made a market in speculative &lsquo;<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrishamby/not-just-a-court-system-its-a-gold-mine?utm_term=.baj59bDzr#.aa6NX9gxe">potential-ISDS-payouts</a>&rsquo; derivatives. The only value of such derivatives is is their abililty to extract money from taxpayers.

<p class="epi">&lsquo;Responsibility remains so diffuse, and top executives so insulated, that any misconduct could again be considered more a symptom of the institution's culture than a result of the willful actions of any single individual.&rsquo; [So said] Attorney General Eric Holder, the chief architect of the crazily elaborate government policy of surrender, secrecy and cover-up, explaining why the Justice Department failed to prosecute Chase when &hellip; &lsquo;the proof is easily there for all the elements of the crime as defined by federal law &mdash; the bank made material misrepresentations, it made material omissions, and it did so willfully and with specific intent, consciously ignoring warnings from inside the firm and out&rsquo;. &mdash; <a class="fn">

<p>By intention, the Constitutional authority of Congress &lsquo;to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations&rsquo; (Article I.8.3) includes:

<ul>
<li>Selection of trading partners;
<li>Writing the legislation that sets the terms of trade agreements;
<li>Review by Congressional committees with the power to subpoena witnesses and seek advice from experts;
<li>Accountability to the electorate through public hearings, Fourth Estate reportage, editorial criticism, activist lobbying, and informed input from those affected (you!).
</ul>
</p>

<p>This clumsy, time/consuming process, carried out in the public eye, naturally obstructs the advance of feudofascism. Accordingly, in 1974 Nixon introduced Fast Track. (How this was done, and why our legislators allowed it, I have not learned, but we called him &lsquo;Tricky Dick&rsquo; for a reason. Since W-Bush used it also, it may have required nothing more than Congressional laziness and poor judgement: &lsquo;Let the pros do the work&rsquo;. In any case, there were numerous corporate lobbyists on board with the usual means of persuasion.) The results have not been in the public interest. According to Citizens Trade Campaign, Fast track &lsquo;delegates five major elements of Congress&apos;s constitutional authority to the executive branch, the power to:

<ol>
<li>select trading partners;
<li>set the terms of trade agreements and to actually sign the agreements before Congress votes on them;
<li>write implementing legislation, circumvent Congressional committee review and submit the legislation directly for a vote;
<li>override Congressional leaders&apos; control of House and Senate floor schedules; and
<li>override normal voting procedures, including a ban on all amendments and limits on debate.&rsquo;
<li>In addition, hundreds of corporate lobbyists are granted official trade-advisor status, while the general public has no right to see what is being proposed until negotiations have concluded, the agreement is signed and changes are impossible.
</ol>
</p>

<p>The last time Congress handed its authority over to the White House in this manner was during the George W. Bush administration, at 3:28 in the morning on 27 July 2002, by just a two-vote majority. Obama&apos;s cabinet-level trade adviser Ron Kirk, said, &lsquo;In order for us to conclude the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreement, we&apos;re going to have to have [Fast Track] trade promotion authority.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>This is law making by and for the benefit of corporate management, the 1&permil; whose overriding concern is management emolument.

<p>Some examples of how corporations abuse the rights of people &mdash; collected by the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/01/20-5" (as of 2013-10-21><i>Common Dreams</i></a> quango &mdash; might not be amiss.
</p>

<ul class=u1>
<li>The 1st Amendment&apos;s Free Speech clause was subverted by the &lsquo;Money is speech&rsquo; ruling of <cite>Citizens United</cite>, to allow corporations to lie freely about their practices, products, and policies. I would suggest a year in prison for each instance of each lie (where &lsquo;instance&rsquo; means one billboard, or one broadcast of a TV spot), beginning at the top (Board of Directors, owner, whatever), with the intent of incarcerating as much of management as it takes to stop the lies.</li>

<li>The 4th Amendment Search and Seizure rights have been used to avoid subpoenas for unlawful trade and price fixing, and to prevent citizens, communities and regulatory agencies from stopping corporate pollution and other assaults on people and communities.</li>

<li>The 5th Amendment&apos;s Takings, Double Jeopardy and Due Process clauses have been used to claim that corporations must be compensated for loss of future profits when regulations are established to protect homeowners or communities. Corporations cannot be retried after a judgment of acquittal in court. The granting of property to a corporation by a public official cannot be unilaterally revoked by a subsequent public official or Act of Congress.</li>

<li>The 14th Amendment&apos;s Due Process and Equal Protection provisions, originally enacted to guarantee equal protection for freed slaves, were gradually extended to corporations by the courts. Corporations have used these rights to build chain stores and erect cell towers against the will of communities; oppose tax and other public policies supporting local businesses over multinational corporations; and resist democratic efforts to prevent corporate mergers and revoke corporate charters through citizen initiatives.</li>

<li>The Commerce Clause (Art 1, Sec 8) has been used to ship toxic waste from one state to another over the &lsquo;health, safety, and welfare&rsquo; objections of communities by claiming the waste isn&apos;t actually waste but &lsquo;commerce&apos;.</li>

<li>The Contracts Clause (Art 1, Sec 10) was subverted early, when
<cite>Dartmouth vs. Woodward</cite> (1819) held that a corporation is a party in a private contract rather than being a creature of public law. (Even though the state creates a corporation when it issues a charter, that state is not sovereign over the charter, merely a party to the contract.) Thus, corporations became &lsquo;private contracts&rsquo; with the state and, therefore, shielded from many forms of democratic control.</li>

</ul>


<p>Among the non-traditional constraints, #12 is needed because &lsquo;Justices have [&hellip;] struck down hundreds of local, state and federal laws enacted to protect people from corporate harm, based on [the] illegitimate premise [of corporate personhood]&rsquo;, according to Reclaim Democracy.
</p>

<p>Constraint 13 is simple anti-fascism. #14 is needed to prevent the export of abusive practices. #15 will be welcomed by all who regard <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite> as scripture.

</p>

<p>Constraint 11 is the current hot spot. Jefferson and Madison recognized the need to limit the power of corporations in the Bill of Rights &mdash; a need still unmet. In 1941 a Congressional committee reported,
</p>

<blockquote>The principal instrument of the concentration of economic power and wealth has been the corporate charter with unlimited power.

<p>Profit made during the Civil War gave corporations the financial clout to persuade (read &lsquo;pay&rsquo;) Congress to begin the rescission of these essential rules. The pressure is relentless, continuing to this day, with the most notable failure of democracy being the incremental acceptance of corporate personhood.

<p>All that we need to know about the merit of granting corporations the same protection that the Bill of Rights gives to individuals is contained in <a class="fn">CEO pay.<span>
	The Dodd-Frank <cite>Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</cite> is a federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama 2010-06-21, but 4 years later it has not been implemented by the SEC. It requires companies to report CEO income and the pay ratio between the CEO and the median worker. One administrative difficulty is that in addition to his salary, the CEO&apos;s remuneration may include &lsquo;bonus, stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, perquisites, personal benefits, and property with an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000; tax gross-ups; company contributions to defined contribution retirement plans; preferential stock purchase discounts; preferential life insurance premiums; and dividends or other earnings&rsquo;. Since no extant accounting system includes all of these, independent attempts to calculate the pay ratio arrive at different figures, coming up with numbers for US CEO-to-worker pay that range from 12 to 656.
</span></a> In the UK, the ratio of CEO-to-median-worker pay in different sectors goes </p>

<p class="cen">private : public : voluntary :: 262 : 15 : 10. </p>

<p class="flu">The 262/15 = 17.5 ratio between private and public CEO pay completely explains the goals of privatization, all other &lsquo;explanations&rsquo; being attempts to conceal this overriding purpose. The voluntary sector is an empirical evaluation of the CEO&apos;s real worth, in complete agreement with Mondrag&oacute;n&apos;s. Harvard&apos;s <a href=#" class="fn">Rakesh Khurana<span>R Khurana (2002) <cite>Searching for a Corporate Savior</cite> (Princeton UP).</span></a> has shown that the return on investment in CEO pay is poor compared to other investment options.
</p>

<p>Most educated individuals in the West (excluding the MBA set?) have internalized the ethical standards of the Judaeo-Christian tradition and Enlightenment. The CEO-pay disparity shows that the corporate culture has not, evidently compelled by the monodimensionality of finance to remain mired in Instinct-1 &mdash; which needs no encouragement to override our finer sensibilities. The CEO will come to believe that his pay reflects his wisdom, acumen, importance, and divine right. The Louis XIV syndrome kicks in: &lsquo;<a class="fn">La paye, c&apos;est moi<span>
	In April 1755, Louis &mdash; not having a speechwriter &mdash; apparently said something arrogant to the Paris Parlement which was epitomized by Voltaire into the unforgetable &lsquo;L&apos;Etat, c&apos;est moi!&rsquo;.
</span></a>&rsquo;, and spreads through corporate management, which can thereafter do no wrong.
</p>

<p>The need for Constraint 11 was largely unrecognized until an 1886 tax-evasion case in which the Southern Pacific Railroad claimed equal protection as a legal person under the <a class="fn">14th Amendment<span>
	<cite>Santa Clara County vs. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.</cite> 118 US 394 (1886). A few years earlier, Justice Miller had correctly observed that the &lsquo;person&rsquo; of the 14th Amendment was specifically &lsquo;the newly made freeman and citizen&rsquo; who was to be protected &lsquo;from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him&rsquo; {83 U.S. 36 (1872)}, and was never meant to include an artificial person.
</span></a> (&lsquo;no state shall make or enforce any law which shall &hellip; deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&rsquo;).The question of &lsquo;corporate personhood&rsquo; was never addressed by Congress nor argued by the Supreme Court, but was simply written into the Syllabus (summary) of case law by J.C. Bancroft Davis, former president of the Newburgh and New York Railway Company, who apparently turned law clerk for this specific purpose. Within 3 years this case was <a class="fn">cited as a precedent<span>
	<cite>Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Company</cite> 129 US 26 (1899).
</span></a> for corporate personhood by Justice Field. Since any competent law clerk will have noticed that &lsquo;corporate personhood&rsquo; is not law, its persistent appearance in this guise is treason contravening the Constitution&apos;s &lsquo;general Welfare&rsquo; function. <cite>Citizens United</cite> &mdash; (citing <cite>Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm&apos;n of Cal.</cite>, 475 U. S. 1, 8 (1986)), imagined that

	In my early teens, there was a mystique about the Justices of the Supreme Court, holding that no matter their failings on the lower bench, they seemed quickly to grow to meet the new challenge. Unaware of any case law, I nevertheless grew up feeling that they were stalwart defenders of the ideas I valued. I do not know the source of this feeling, but there was a certain truth to it. Can you imagine anyone feeling that way about the 5 corporate toadies on the bench today?
</span></a> The majority of today stockholders own miniscule portions of thousands of companies, (selected by the managers of their mutual funds purely on the basis of financial return), and have no control over how the corporations use their profits to influence legislation and legislators.
</p>

<p>A corporation being owned by its shareholders, its &lsquo;personhood&rsquo; puts them in the legal position of owning a person, prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. That may be a legalistic argument, but the National Lawyers Guild has a better one:
</p>

<blockquote>We oppose recognition of the personhood of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment. Protections of the Bill of Rights are given to people out of a concern for human dignity, liberty or equality. Corporate claims to such protections should be rejected.
</blockquote>

<p>An example of the abuse which this misplaced protection permits is Nike&apos;s 2003 complaint that its &lsquo;Bill of Rights freedom of speech&rsquo; was violated when Marc Kasky charged (correctly) that its advertizing lied about its labor practices. Kasky was supported, as he should have been, by the California Supreme Court:
</p>

<blockquote>Our holding &hellip; in no way prohibits any business enterprise from speaking out on issues of public importance or from vigorously defending its own labor practices. It means only that when a business enterprise, [speaks] to promote and defend its sales and profits, it must speak truthfully. [&hellip; W]e do not consider this a remarkable or intolerable burden to impose on the business community. &mdash; <a class="fn">{02 CDOS 3790}.<span>
	Nike appealed to the US Supreme Court, but the case was settled out of court for a pittance &mdash; half a day&apos;s advertizing budget for Nike (M$1.5) to the Fair Labor Association, over whose actions board member Nike holds a veto power. Such behavior only reinforces public suspicion that the Supreme Court&apos;s understanding of the Constitution has been warped by undue corporate influence.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Not surprisingly, The Council of Public Relations Firms thought that
</p>

<blockquote>[T]he rights of all American companies to speak out freely on issues and to openly and fully inform the public about their products and services will be in severe jeopardy
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">if they were subjected to the intolerable expectation of telling the truth! Revealing the unethical aspirations of corporation lawyers, the <i>amici curiae</i> brief from the advertizing industry whined:
</p>

<blockquote>Because all corporate speech is, <b>and should be, uttered in the interests of benefitting the corporation in the eyes of potential consumers</b>, [as opposed, in particular, to telling the truth] the speech-restricting effects of the California Supreme Court&apos;s test will be enormous&rsquo; (emphasis added).

<p>Perhaps the &lsquo;corporate person&rsquo; is not entirely destructive. It offers a novel way of constraining corporations. Contempt of court is commonly used to persuade a person to behave properly (according to Wikipedia, yawning at the wrong moment in a courtroom can result in a contempt of court charge!). Indicting a &lsquo;corporate person&rsquo; for contempt of court must mean &mdash; as it does for other persons &mdash; depriving it of its ability to interact with the outside world. This would require incarcerating a sufficient number of its decision-makers to render it impotent for the period of the sentence. A little constructive case law here could imprison the entire

management (down to some level deemed incapacitating to business) <i>and</i> the Board of Directors. 90 days in the clink would be an instructive experience for such people, offering them a personal view of just how despicable the public often finds corporate behavior. A corporation headless for a full quarter might send a message that even the stockmarket and investors understood.
</p>

<p><cite>Hobby Lobby</cite>, more rancid case law from the Roberts Court, pierces the &lsquo;corporate veil&rsquo; (which protects management from responsibility for what they do in the name of the corporation). The veil is obviously crucial to sociopathic corporate behavior, so the expectation was that the Court would protect the veil. But religion trumped protection, and the Court decided, in effect, that the beliefs of the corporate person (by extension those of its management), took priority over the beliefs of employees. Expressed more formally in an <i>amicus curia</i> brief,
</p>

<blockquote>Allowing a corporation &hellip; to take on and assert the religious beliefs of its shareholders in order to avoid having to comply with a generally applicable law with a secular purpose is fundamentally at odds with the entire concept of incorporation. Creating such an unprecedented and idiosyncratic tear in the corporate veil would also carry with it unintended consequences, many of which are not easily foreseen. &mdash; 44 law professors. [Judging by responses to a Senate committee, candidates interviewed for Federal judgeships often see law professors as an unqualified nuisance.]

</p>

<ul>
<li>the attitude that &lsquo;corporate speech &hellip; should be uttered in the interests of benefitting the corporation&rsquo;,</li>

<li>the money available to corporate managers,</li>

<li>the high costs of political campaigns,</li>

<li>the potential for <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption,</li>

<li>the corrupting influence of access provided by large campaign contributions, and</li>

<li>&lsquo;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth &hellip; that have little or no correlation to the public&apos;s support for the corporation&apos;s political ideas&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>


<p><cite>Citizens United</cite> challenged one such ruling (&lsquo;441&rsquo;) that prevented corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that was an &lsquo;electioneering communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&rsquo; from being publicly distributed shortly before an election.
</p>

<p>Revealing, perhaps, their underlying feudofascist agenda, the Supreme Court sent the brief back to Citizens United asking that they enlarge the complaint so that the Court could rule on larger issues. To paraphrase <cite>Citizens United</cite>, the Court took 183 pages to say the following:
</p>

<blockquote>Two centuries of experience left us with laws that &lsquo;prohibit corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that is an <q>electioneering communication</q> &rsquo; (441), and hold that &lsquo;political speech may be banned based on the speaker&apos;s corporate identity&rsquo; (<cite>Austin</cite>).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>We, however, find that a corporation is an association of individuals, so it inherits their right to free speech. Accordingly:
</blockquote>

<ul class="u3" style="color: brown;">
<li>&bull; <cite>Austin</cite> is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures, and</li>

<li>&bull; 441&apos;s restrictions on independent corporate expenditures is also overruled.</li>
</ul>


<p>Think about that for a minute. If, like me, your pension is a mutual fund, then independently of your own action or choice, you own stock in several thousand corporations, <b><i>all of whom, using return on our investments, will speak in favor of their interests and with no concern for ours</i></b>.
</p>

<p>I, at least, am more than likely to disagree with their individual political agendas, being willing to absorb whatever loss my pension takes if they limit their political activity to writing letters to Congress (as I do). I <i>want</i> them to abide by minimum-wage laws, environmental restrictions, and other rational constraints &mdash; however galling they are to the feudal mentality. Chief Justice Roberts made a category error when he lumped (1) the free association of like minds and (2) the purely financial contract. Both may be called a &lsquo;corporation&rsquo; (as Roberts did) &mdash; but this is a linguistic convenience that defies the obvious ethical distinction.
</p>

<p>The degree of endemic corruption in the electoral process is revealed by an opinion from a former Federal Election Commissioner:

<blockquote>The evidence is pretty overwhelming that the money does not play much of a role in what goes on in terms of legislative voting patterns and legislative behavior. &mdash; Bradley Smith
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">This is absurd. The people who spend the money are  sure that they are buying results: they didn&apos;t amass their billions by foolish spending.
</p>

<p>In the long run, one hopes that Justice Stevens&apos;s logical dissent will be what is cited from this fiasco.
</p>

<blockquote>[T]he Court&apos;s opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. {558 U. S. ____ (2010) Stevens, dissenting, p 90}
</blockquote>

<p>As of mid 2013, 175 jurisdictions had voted in favor of a Constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United. Common sense still rules at the local level!

<p>Subsidies to industry are not considered in Table 23.6, since some subsidies are a beneficial use of public money. The table shows only that the corporate income tax is not working as intended. Corporations claim that they pay state and local taxes, and that the low federal rate is used by Congress to create jobs and opportunities for US business. They further claim that taxing the corporations and its members is unfair double taxation. Perhaps giving them what they want is the fairest approach: No federal tax on corporation income &mdash; but a fiercely progressive tax on personal income (counting all of a CEO&apos;s perks as income), a tax on advertizing (the more useful something is, the less advertizing it needs), and, as mentioned above, a tax on financial transactions. </p>

</p>


<p>As Condorcet explained long ago, there is no guaranteed way to define &lsquo;the most preferred&rsquo; candidate in a multi-candidate election. (The rock-scissors-paper game shows why.) Two dozen systems of preferential voting have been suggested to resolve this problem (search for <a href="http://www.electology.org/approval-voting">Approval Voting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Preferential_voting">Preferential Voting</a>, and <a href="http://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> for details), but problems of <a class="fn">indeterminacy<span>

</span></a> remain. None is perfect; any is preferable to our current 2-party first-past-the-post.
</p>

<p>The spirit of &lsquo;One person, one vote&rsquo; requires that politics be as free as possible from the influence of private, and <i>particularly corporate</i>, money. Changing campaign-financing rules has had little effect in the US. One alternative is Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig&apos;s &lsquo;Democracy Vouchers&rsquo;, $50 rebates to every taxpayer, to be given to candidates of their choice who accept <i>only</i> such funds plus contributions limited to $100 per citizen. The $50 rebates would amount to G$7; the 2010 Congressional elections spent less than G$2, so the rebates should fund a presidential election handily. <a class="fn">Lessig<span>
	Lessig (2012} <cite>One Way Forward</cite> (Byliner, San Francisco).
</span></a> stops at this point, having described a system which might return control of government to the public. See his video <a href="http://vimeo.com/38644668">Buying Votes</a> (as of 2012-03-15).
</p>

<p>Another approach offers an equal public purse to each candidate, scaled to the size of the electorate, and lets them raise whatever other money they can. Recognizing the economic fact that candidates buy votes &mdash; with ads, with promises, with outright lies, with <i>quid pro quo</i> deals, whatever &mdash; it <b>elects the person who buys the most votes per campaign dollar</b>. This removes the urge to spend, and selects winners who spend wisely &mdash; a skill we can surely use in government! Three reasons for trying this are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a known practice: money goes where it promises the most return (in votes) per dollar spent.</li>

<li>&lsquo;Advertizing cost is inversely proportional to utility&rsquo;: The less we need something, the more it costs us to be persuaded to buy it. In the 2014 Democratic NY gubernatorial primary, Andrew Cuomo spent $60.62 per vote; his opponent, Zephyr Teachout, spent $1.57, and got 40% of the vote, suggesting that Teachout&apos;s campaign was 26 times as appealing to the voters as Cuomo&apos;s. How do you think this election would have
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"/></a>
turned out with &lsquo;equal arms&rsquo;?</li>

<li>We can examine an abundance of historical data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not the place to explore the historical data, but the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/"> Center for Responsive Politics/OpenSecrets</a> has records of recent Federal campaigns, and 90% of the time, <a class="fn">money wins.<span>
	The details are complex and deserve study. In the House, the average vote/$ ratio is 4% higher for winners, which is in the direction it should be. In the Senate, with 8 times the spending, the vote/$ ratio is 15% higher for losers; with equal spending (and a postulated linear relation between spending and voter response), the loser would have arguably have gotten 57.5% of the vote, so money introduces a serious distortion of popular will {data from The Center for Responsive Politics}. In short: &lsquo;House seats are fought; Senate seats bought&rsquo;.

<p>Now that the idea has been suggested, it occurs to me that since corporations seem to be the principal instigators and beneficiaries of war, we should extend this requirement to include the offspring of upper management of companies that sell to the military.

<p>Science, like religion, has proven corruptible by greed. It is difficult enough to win new knowledge from Nature without being asked to do this for the profit of a single organization. The pressure results in science frauds.
</p>

<p>Some blame scientists, or science itself, for the ills of the world, including nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the first use we made of sticks &mdash; judging by our relatives the chimpanzees &mdash; was as spears. So far, chimps have been observed spearing only sleeping bush babies to fish them out of holes, but someday one will be seen using a club or spear to kill another chimp. Every technological advance has been used to kill other people. It was not scientists who gave whiskey and small-pox infected blankets to Native Americans. Such things are the work of Instinct-1, independent of the state of current knowledge.
</p>

<p>Left to its own devices, Science is intellectually honest. There are 2 reasons for this. Firstly, science was traditionally not a paying occupation, but the hobby of the curious. Those who did it, did it for fun. Secondly, science is &mdash; we may have mentioned this before &mdash; self correcting. No matter how convinced one might be about the validity of an erroneous hypothesis, sooner or later factual data compel correction. Clever people notice this and do not deliberately lie. They may fool themselves, but they do not set out to fool others. Corruption enters through the unconscious awareness that pleasing their paymaster puts food on the table. This happens most often among those supported by tobacco, petroleum, pesticide, and pharmaceutical companies, and by doublethink-tanks with a political agenda. For example:
</p>

<blockquote>I defy anyone to read &hellip; <cite>The Cigarette Century</cite>, which details the founding of the Tobacco Institute and the industry&apos;s efforts to muddy scientific waters, and not come away with a burning need to drive down to North Carolina and find someone to throttle. &mdash; Bryan Burrough reviewing <a href=#" class="fn">Alan Brandt&apos;s<span>

</blockquote>

<p>We need ways to support research that are not biased by secondary considerations. Double-blind procedures are <a class="fn">essential<span>
	Essential, but not sufficient, as Angell&apos;s epigraph shows. We need emphatic ways to control this sort of corruption.
</span></a> in medical research. If neither the patients, physicians, nor evaluators of a drug trial can identify test and control groups, unconscious bias cannot creep in. Without this precaution, the doctors&rsquo; expectations, the effects of suggestion on the patients, and the evaluators&rsquo; prejudices confound the issue.

<p>Corporate support of academic research is a practice to be encouraged &mdash; but it should be double blind, with the money going to, and awarded by, the National Science Foundation, and neither corporation nor researcher knowing the other.
</p>

</span></a> in favor of the money source. When a scientist is dependent upon soft money (with salary and support coming from research grants) the pressure to keep body and soul together, grad students and technicians supported, deans mollified, and tenure committees impressed, is a potent influence upon his interpretation of results. University administrators do not look at the science, but at &lsquo;productivity&apos;, primarily in terms of the overhead money accompanying an external grant for scientific research. It is not unusual in this game for a soft-money researcher to devote 25% of her time to proposal writing rather than productive work, so she either works <a class="fn">longer hours<span>

	I once tried Fermi&apos;s ploy of doing the research before requesting the money. Theoretically, this enables one to describe the &lsquo;expected&rsquo; results in detail and acquire a reputation for delivering what was proposed. My proposal was rejected by reviewers who were sure it wouldn&apos;t work.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>The corruption of science is more contemptible than the corruption of law and religion. These fields lack self-correction, and the most we can hope for is to muddle our way toward a <a class="fn">better system.<span>
	To be sure, devotees of religion may fail to recognize this.
</span></a> The self-correction of science guarantees that mistakes and misinterpretations will eventually be discovered, and this feature usually prevents intellectual dishonesty. This gives us confidence in the work of others and enables us to build upon it without repeating their experiments. Get caught lying about the results, and before long, scientists are no more trustworthy than lawyers, the public sees science itself as no more than perverse opinions, and the Dark Ages are here again. The Enlightenment might as well not have happened, and witch-burning, here we come.

<p class="epi">[A]ll credible energy forecasters &mdash; the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Agency and [ExxonMobil] economists &mdash; agree that the global energy system is so vast and complex that carbon-based energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal will continue to meet upwards of 70 percent of global energy needs until at least the middle of the century. &mdash;
</p>

<p>Perhaps more than any other signal, the 2016 Presidential campaign showed the need for repair in our teaching of science. As we saw in <a href="F22.shtml#04">Chapter 22</a>, &lsquo;we&rsquo; &mdash; the relevant scientific community &mdash; knew by the end of the 19th century that anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> would lead to global heating.

<ul><li>It is not possible to increase the altitude of the Earth&apos;s radiation surface without increasing the temperature at ground level.</li>

<li>It is not possible to add trimolecular gasses such as CO<sub>2</sub> the atmosphere without raising the radiation surface.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">These are indisputable facts of thermodynamics. One can argue about the details, as scientists did until 1961, when the Keeling Curve was published. After that, one is arguing about ethics: &lsquo;Is the convenience to me of driving a car to work more important than the consequences to the world?&rsquo; I answered that affirmatively for the next 21 years, by which time the consequences were clear enough to make my personal answer, &lsquo;No, I have to think of a better approach.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>After another 34 years (2016), Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil&apos;s Vice President of Public and Government Affairs, was still claiming that because
</p>

<blockquote>many important questions about climate science remained unanswered, and more research was required
</blockquote>

<p class="flu"> &mdash; which is perfectly true <i>and totally irrelevant</i> &mdash; Exxon was innocent of misleading the public about the effects of fossil carbon. She also referred people to ExxonMobil internal reports, among which the first paragraph I read explained:

<blockquote>It is now clear to most people working in the area that the [CO<sub>2</sub>] doubling time will be much later in the future [~2065] that [sic] previously postulated <b>because of the decreasing rate of fossil fuel use</b> &mdash; <a class="fn">H Shaw and PP McCall<span>

</blockquote>

<p class="flu">in which the emphasized explanation is simply preposterous. No energy researcher in 1980 expected fossil-fuel consumption to decrease as population, affluence, and energy use increased!
</p>

<p>McCarron&apos;s defense of the purity of academic energy research sponsored by Exxon quietly overlooked the 8-fold bias introduced by commercial sponsorship. The most generous explanation of Exxon&apos;s inability to notice global heating is the fact alreay mentioned: There is no resolution of the problem which is both politically and ecologically acceptable. We cannot bring 7 billion people up to the European standard of energy usage without losing the ability to feed them, without a revolutionary reorganization of corporate society. Expectations-as-usual are not realistic.

<a href="#TOC"   id="39"> Pessimal Reading of Scripture </a>
<a class="tri" href="#40">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p><i><a href=”../_G/Glo.shtml#po”>Popoco</a></i> tells us that we should look for the good in other people&apos;s religion, just as we do in our own. Experience suggests that both approaches are counterproductive, and offers a simple starting point for repairs.
</p>

<p>The Old Testament retains YHVH&apos;s original instructions, without the corrective rabbinical commentary. The Paulist conversion of Jesus from a revolutionary Hassidic rabbi into an incarnation of god was accompanied by Paul&apos;s signature tetrad of homophobia, misogyny, <i>sola fideism</i>, and an exploitive attitude toward nature.
</p>

<p>Islam has been sanitizing its scriptures since Ibn Hisham bowdlerized Ibn Ishaq&apos;s biography of Muhamad, &lsquo;removing everything he found objectionable&rsquo;. Mawdudi obviously found much more that was objectionable in his day, and removed it from his version. But the Quran itself remains inviolate, with Muhamad&apos;s Neolithic violence in full view.
</p>

<p>This survival of Neolithic reponses in the Old Testament and Quran, and the Paulist tetrad in the New Testament, and similar anomalies in Hinduism, mean that Scripture should be judged by reading it with the nastiest possible interpretation. Experience shows that if the civilized fraction of the congregation doesn&apos;t do this, the uncivilized will.</p>

<p>Example, Christianity on homosexuality:</p>

<ul>
<li>The optimal reading is what Jesus himself said about it:
<blockquote>&lsquo; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &rsquo;
</blockquote>

which is fully in keeping with the finding by the <a class="fn"><cite>The San Francisco Study</cite><span>
	AP Bell, MS Weinberg (1978) <cite>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</cite> (Indiana University Press, Bloomington IN).
</span></a> that homosexuality is biological rather than psychological.</li>

<li>The pessimal reading, far more common among the <i>sine scriptura</i> churches, is Paul&apos;s confused ambisexual homophobia {Rom 1:27, 1 Cor 6:9, 1 Tim 1:10}. Dipping into the Old Testament, there are instructions to kill gays {Lev 20:13} &mdash; and sure enough, some people whose self-image overflows with Christian lovingkindness are anxious to do just this.</li>
</ul>


<p>The logical result of a pessimal reading of one&apos;s own scripture would be to clean it up. Islam has a mechanism for this in abrogation, but has never used it in this manner. Before Islam can be considered a candidate for a world religion, it needs to reverse its current approach, affirm that its inhumane and antisocial verses are abrogated by the civilized ones, <i>and remove them</i>. If it resolutely and publicly discarded things like amputation, <i>bid&apos;a</i>, blasphemy, death for apostasy, female genital mutilation (obligatory under Shafi&apos;i jurisprudence), forced conversion, homophobia, jihad, lapidation, mysogyny, polygamy, pornographic paradise, <i>shirk</i>, slavery, theocratic totalitarianism, and similar anachronisms, it might become acceptable among civilized nations. It might consider adopting the original (1948) <a class="fn"><cite>UN Declaration of Human Rights</cite><span>
	In practice, Islamic pressure forced the removal of the implicit right to change religions from the Declaration!
</span></a> as its Eirenic sura, since this accomplishes the desired end in a formal manner which other institutions know how to work with. This would incidentally destroy Mohammatism, leaving Islam free to blossom.
</p>

<p>Given that the justification for some of Mohammatism&apos;s worst practices are Leviticus and Deuteronomy, we might drop these book from Scripture, keeping them as historical examples of Neolithic superstition. Leviticus is relevant only to rabbis and Deuteronomy&apos;s revelatory nature is dubious in the extreme. We could do this in a scholarly manner, burying the offending verses in future publications of the Old Testament by including the commentary of rabbinical debate. This would add <a class="fn">relevant portions<span>
	M Rodkinson (1918) <cite>The Babylonian Talmud</cite> (The Talmud Soc., Boston)
</span></a> of the 10-volume English abridgement of the Talmud, and be a literary improvement over the Bible itself, as the Talmud is &lsquo;infused with vigorous intellectual debate, humor and deep wisdom &hellip; based equally on scripture and appeals to an emerging standard of common-sense justice and human rights&rsquo;. It would have the advantage of increasing recognition of the common content of the Abrahamic religions, since most Islamic legends had their origin in the Talmud, as does much of the work of the Church Fathers, and many of the tales of Boccaccio, Cervantes, Dante, and Milton.
</p>

<p>Sufism, mentioned in passing several times in earlier chapters, may not immediately seem familiar to Western readers. Yet most of us recognize more Sufic material than Quranic &mdash; for Omar Khayyam was a Sufi. The <i>carpe diem</i> enthusiasm and celebration of wine in the <cite>Rubaiyat</cite> have ecumenically migrated into Irish folksong:
</p>

<p class="poem">Oh, let us sing then, I and <a class="fn">Thou,<span>
	Just for the record, be it noted that both the &lsquo;I&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Thou&rsquo; are male in the <cite>Rubaiyat</cite>.
</span></a><br>
We&apos;ve Paradise beneath the Bough.<br>
A loaf of Bread shall be our Lunch,<br>
A Book of Verse, and &mdash; a Jug of Punch. &mdash; <cite>The Rubaiyat</cite> XI.
</p>

<p>The view that early Mohammatism was a Judaeo-Christian &lsquo;heresy&rsquo; might profitably be publicized. Most of the better heresies (along with some entirely unnecessary ones) co-exist among Protestants, so why not one more? Salvific and ritual details fall under <i>de gustibus</i> or tribal markers, and do not matter outside the congregation!
</p>

<p id="39a">During the long unrest preceding the partition of India into Hindu and Moslem enclaves, Dr Mohammed Iqbal based his 1930 Presidential Address to the All India Muslim League on an optimal reading of the Quran (&lsquo;O people of the Book; Come, let us join together on the <q>word</q> [Unity of God], that is common to us all&rsquo;). His hope was that
</p>

<blockquote>If an effective principle of cooperation is discovered in India, it will bring peace and mutual goodwill to this ancient land which has suffered so long&hellip;. And it will at the same time solve the entire political problem of Asia &mdash;
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">a clear evaluation by a Muslim that Mohammatism itself was the problem. A realistic (pessimal) reading of Muhamadan Scripture &mdash; Bukhari 4:380 on the expulsion of Jews and Christians from <a class="fn">Moslem territory<span>
	Narrated Ibn ʿUmar: &lsquo;Umar bin Al-Khattab expelled all the Jews and Christians from the land of Hijaz. Allah&apos;s Apostle after conquering Khaibar, thought of expelling the Jews from the land which, after he conquered it, belonged to Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle and the Muhamadans. But the Jews requested Allah&apos;s Apostle to leave them there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits (the land would yield). Allah&apos;s Apostle said, <q>We shall keep you on these terms as long as we wish.</q>; Thus they stayed till the time of ʿUmar&apos;s Caliphate when he expelled them to Taima and Ariha.&rsquo;
</span></a> &mdash; would have anticipated the million deaths of the Partition.

<p>The canonical existential questions early acquired consistent canonical answers. Variants of column-2&apos;s answers in Table 23.6 appear in the majority of surviving religions. Most religious people, I suspect, will find the answers here more abrupt and primitive than their own versions. This is eisegesis, reading into their religion what they think it should have, and often a good thing. I pick lowest-common-denominator answers because they clarify the ideas that lie behind them. Behind the answers lie axioms, often implicit, usually unanalyzed. And behind the axioms lie ideals which are more important than the answers.

<p>Religions have usually been content to assume that once the canonical axioms were formulated, only faith and ritual were needed to reveal their truth to us. Maybe this was adequate during the Urzeit, but cultural maturity and the insights given by Enlightenment and research have helped made it clear that if we want closer approaches to the &lsquo;axioms&rsquo;, we have to create them ourselves. Short-term (non-karmic) Theodicy is the easiest of the axioms to implement.

</p>

<p>Iqbal&apos;s Address also asked, &lsquo;Would you like to see Islam, as a moral and political ideal, meeting the same fate in the world of Islam as Christianity has already met in Europe?&rsquo; &mdash; that is, with <a href="../_B/B07.shtml#09">critical analysis</a> of the Quran and Traditional Account? The correct answer is a resounding &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; &mdash; but Islam violently opposes Quranic criticism. Muslim scholarship is proud of its long history of theology, but it is hard to see why. The basis of Islamic criticism is that the Quran is true and anything that contradicts it is false. This precludes any improvement to what the Quranic collectors pieced together. Many aspects of Christian Scriptures are logically contradictory, but the Quran is particularly defective in this respect. Not everyone sees this:
</p>

<blockquote>Knowing the Quran&apos;s origination from the Creator means knowing its eloquence is not in man&apos;s ability to <a class="fn">match.<span>
	An equally valid description of the same text might say, &lsquo;This is so garbled that I can&apos;t make sense out of it&rsquo;.
 &hellip; There is not one line in the Quran that can be linguistically improved in any way. It is perfect in its original form. Logic meant learning how to set up an argument with clear thinking [sic]. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	FA Haase<span> (ed.) (2003) <cite>Language Cultures</cite> (Universität Tübingen): 117&ndash;118.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Compulsive literalism seems a concomitant of fundamentalism. Both Christian and Moslem fundamentalists claim there are no contradictions in their scriptures, because &lsquo;contradiction&rsquo; for them is necessarily explicit, saying both A and not-A. Implicit contradictions &mdash; such as a &lsquo;merciful&rsquo; god who arbitrarily casts people into eternal punishment &mdash; are avoided by instinctively applying &lsquo;merciful&rsquo; to Us and &lsquo;punishment&rsquo; to Them.
</p>

<p>The Quran often says both A and not-A, but space allows only the example of tolerance. The challenge can be seen in Table 23.7, which shows the revelation sequence of 5 principal verses discussing tolerance. <a class="fn">Islamic scholars<span>

</span></a> have found 9 Islamic interpretations of the &lsquo;no compulsion in religion&rsquo; phrase of Sura 2:256. One way to reconcile its internal contradictions is to read it as: &lsquo;Now that we know there is only one right way, everyone one will accept it automatically and we won&apos;t need to force them.&rsquo; The standard interpretation in most times and places has been that people who don&apos;t accept Islam automatically &mdash; such as apostates, women, children, prisoners of war, Jews, Christians, and infidels &mdash; can indeed be compelled. What remains open to choice (by the man of the family) is his particular variant of Islam. Wives and whatnot will naturally follow his choice.

Abrogation or Indecision? It appears that Allah was unable to make up his mind about tolerance, and that every time he weakened and admitted that other religions were not totally evil, he immediately changed his mind. Column 2 gives the traditional sequence number of the revelation.

<p>Given that Sura 2:256 is ambiguous, we have 3.5/1.5 for intolerance. The contrast between internal and external views of Islam shows how impervious Islam is to self-criticism. Why should this be? Is it because Islamic education encourages mental compartmentalization and ignores implicit contradictions? A &lsquo;good&rsquo; Muslim may not have to ignore them, he simply be incapable of seeing them, as was Muhamad.
</p>

<p>It takes time to remove traits like this from religions. Christianity in its own 14th century was still in this mode:
</p>

<blockquote>Christian and Catholic sons may accuse their fathers of the crime of heresy &hellip; although they may know that their parents will be burnt with fire and put to death for it. &hellip; And not only may they refuse them food, if they attempt to turn them from the Catholic faith, but they may also justly kill them. &mdash; <a class="fn">Jesuit Precept<span>
	F. Stephen Fagundez, <cite>Proecepta Decalogi</cite> (Lugduni, 1640).

	R Sheldrake (1981) <cite>A New Science of Life</cite> (Icon Books, London, 2009). [Click for more.]
</span></a> really worked, we would find that as soon as the Enlightenment had made clear to Protestants the illogic, futility, and general nastiness of such ideas, other religions would take note and find it much easier to discard them, so we might not have to wait 700 years for Islam to catch up. On the contrary, Moslems regard the Reformation of such practices as a cautionary example showing that Enlightenment values lead to neglect of god&apos;s word.

<p class="epi">[N]o business is so essentially the public business as the industry and commerce on which the people&apos;s livelihood depends, and that to entrust it to private persons to be managed for private profit is a folly similar in kind, though vastly greater in magnitude, to that of surrendering the functions of political government to kings and nobles to be conducted for their personal glorification. &mdash; Edward Bellamy, <cite>Looking Backward</cite>.
</p>

<p>Having rounded Brown&apos;s suggested annual total of G$191 up to G$200, we now have to consider how to deal with this number. There are 4 things to be said about it.
</p>

<ol class="o2" style="color:black;">
<li>It is reasonable: an annual $33/person for 20 years. Adding the Stern Report&apos;s G$300 brings the cost up to $83/person. Granted, we in the West will have to pay more, but we spend more than that for a night out.</li>

<li>Plan B costs 20% of what the world spends on armaments (G$1235 in 2006), and 20% of what crime costs us. In other words, we are already paying 10 times as much for things we don&apos;t want, and we hardly notice. (This is perhaps the best reason for uncoupling elections from the amount spent on political advertizing (see <a href="#30">below</a>). Far too much of the crime-and-armament outlays end up in campaign contributions.)</li>

<li>The clever aspect of Plan B is tax shifting. We now pay more than its cost in destructive subsidies and their associated social costs. The social cost of a pack of cigarets is $10.47 (Center for Disease Control); of a gallon of gasoline, $15 (Center for Technology Assessment). We &mdash; including non-smoking bicyclists &mdash; are already paying these costs. Economic fixes begin with an honest market which pays indirect costs with tax shifting. This does not change the costs, but ensures that those who create them pay for them. This is fair, and is working in northern Europe, encouraging public transport, recycling, energy conservation, and smoking reduction.</li>

<li>We currently subsidize environmentally destructive activities at G$700 annually. Transfer these misplaced subsidies (e.g.: from coal, oil, cattle, farming, mining, timber, airlines), use G$200 for Plan B, add G$300 to deal with Global Heating, and we still have G$200 for investment, research and subsidies to sustainable technology. And it hasn&apos;t cost us an additional cent. Considering that we paid <a class="fn">G$1200-and-counting<span>M Hudson (2009) &lsquo;Bubble Economy 2.0: The Financial Recovery Plan from Hell&rsquo; <cite>Global Research</cite> February 11, 2009</span></a> to reward the MBAs (and 8th-grade stock brokers) whose greed crashed the economic system in 2008, we are not talking about serious amounts of money.</li></ol>

<p>What is hard to come by is the political will, because vested interests that spent years and billions to get the subsidies in place will not stop at polite methods of keeping them in place. We need more ecologists, and fewer lawyers, in Congress.
