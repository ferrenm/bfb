As noted in the <a href="../_A/A00.shtml#01">Preface</a>, the gods seem to expect us to do the heavy lifting of implementing Moral Justice ourselves, now that they have created a universe in which the concept has arisen. This turns out to be a long slow process, with a necessary precondition of cultural longevity. But all of our historically dominant civilizations have ended in unanticipated collapse. We might have been the exception, since as much as <a class="fn">5% of the politically active population<span>
	According to an ephemeral Quinnipiac University Poll of the 2016 Iowa Primary Caucus, 11% of Democrats thought climate change was important, vs &lt;1% of Republicans. (My assessent is that with business-as-usual, global heating will prove to be a culture-breaker and population-reducer.)
</span></a> is aware of the possibility &mdash; although our dominant culture characteristically denies any weakness, either social or environmental. In this situation, the private aspects of religion (belief, church attendance, prayers, tithes, meditation, confession, and whatever personal comfort they bring us) are secondary to its public duty of helping us live together. This means, first of all, <i>survival</i>, or, in more detail, the establishment of a sustainable culture in which energy, population, and resources are in balance. Because survival is not a priority of the market economy &mdash; which at best can only equalize supply and demand at a profit, and its economic &lsquo;long term is tomorrow morning&rsquo; &mdash; this requires serious societal reconstruction. Philosophically, the basic need is to extend synthetic kinship beyond the human community, to encompass the planet, and this is something that forward-looking churches could have help with. We are all in this together.

<p class="epi">Ecology is the study of what economics tries to manage. &mdash; Ferren MacIntyre
</p>

<p>The ideas of Gaian religion, and the geophysiological Gaia of <a class="fn">Dr James Lovelock,<span>
	&bull; JE Lovelock (1972) &lsquo;Gaia as seen through the atmosphere&rsquo; <cite>Atmospheric Environment</cite> <b>6</b>(#8): 579&ndash;580.<br>
	&bull; JE Lovelock, L Margulis (1974) &lsquo;Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: The Gaia hypothesis&rsquo; <cite>Tellus</cite> <b> 26</b>(#1): 2&ndash;10.
	</span></a> are distinct but interlocked. Lovelock noticed 2 apparently unrelated facts about the Earth:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Its atmosphere is maintained in extreme chemical disequilibrium by living organisms.
<li>Its surface temperature has not exceeded the range tolerated by life while the sun has <a class="fn">increased its output<span>
	As nuclear fusion converts hydrogen to helium (nuclearly inert at this point, the helium, 4 times as heavy, falls to the center. The active &lsquo;hydrogen-burning&rsquo; shell outside the inert core is pushed outward, and as its area increases, the solar output increases. This will continue until our oceans boil, by which time we should long since have sent colonies to more hospitable sites.
</span></a> by 25%.
</ul>

<p>Given these facts, he suggested the Gaia <i>Hypothesis</i> of 1972: &lsquo;The whole system of life and its material environment is self-regulating at a state comfortable for the organisms&rsquo;. Many scientists found this idea teleological and untestable, and looked for other explanations, one of which was:
</p>

<blockquote>[C]arbon dioxide in the atmosphere is buffered, over geological time, by negative feedback in which the rate of weathering of silicates (followed by deposition of carbonates) depends on surface temperature, and surface temperature, in turn, depends on carbon dioxide through the greenhouse effect. &mdash; <a class="fn">Walker, Hays, Kasting (1981)<span>
	JCG Walker, PB Hays, JF Kasting (1981) A negative feedback mechanism for the long-term stabilization of Earth&apos;s surface temperature. <cite>J. Geophys. Res.</cite> <b>86</b>(C10): 9776&ndash;9782; doi:10.1029/JC086iC10p09776.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The question boils down to subtle geochemistry, but whenever the choice is dumb luck (weathering rate) vs evolutionary adaptation (Gaia), evolution is a good bet. However, as it happens, the hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Lichens, covering 8% of the Earth’s surface, can accelerate or retard the rate of <a  class="fn">rock weathering<span>

<p>Gaia <i>Theory</i> is the extension of the Gaia Hypothesis by Lovelock and the late Dr Lynn Margulis, which describes the biosphere and its biota as forming a single living macro-organism complete with homeostatic feedback loops. Gaia is this organism &mdash; or, as one of Margulis&apos;s students put it, &lsquo;Gaia is symbiosis seen from space&rsquo; &mdash; described in <a class="fn"><cite>The Ages of Gaia</cite><span>

<p>Brown&apos;s work is authoritative because for 30 years, in annual <cite>State of the World</cite> books, his Worldwatch Institute tracked the efforts of those who are trying to do that often disparaged thing: save the world. We delay the details of financing until the next chapter. Suffice it to say here that the cost is not unreasonable, and we are already paying it in destructive ways, both directly and indirectly. As an example of indirect payment, consider deforestation in China, which between 1950 and 1980 logged 75 million hectares without regard for watershed protection or soil conservation. As a result, droughts in 1997 caused the Yellow River to dry up for 267 days, affecting industrial, agricultural and residential water users in northern China. Floods in 1998 resulted in the loss of 4,150 lives, displacement of millions of people, and economic damages estimated at G$30, with an ongoing annual net loss of G$12 until the forest regrows. When the market price of wood was $57/m<sup>3</sup>, the total cost, including environmental effects, was $102/m<sup>3</sup>. The problem, as always, is that the rich received the $57 and the poor paid the $102, and this is the way the 1&permil; want it: <b>Privatize the profit, socialize the cost!</b>
</p>

<p> UNEP, the UN Environment Program, eventually noticed the need to protect biological diversity, and in mid 2010 allowed its logo to appear on a watered-down European document called <a class="fn"><cite>
	TEEB &ndash; The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Report for Business</cite><span>P Sukhdev (2010) <cite>TEEB &mdash; The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Report for Business</cite> (UNEP, Nairobi).</span></a>.
Because only 27% of sociopathic global CEOs expressed concern about biodiversity loss (and less than 15% of US CEOs), UNEP carefully proclaimed, &lsquo;The views expressed in this report &hellip; may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the organisations involved.&rsquo; This might be considered a recognition of where the cause of the problem lies, and of the baleful influence that proponents of business-as-usual exert on decision-makers.
</p>

<p>The decade of inaction since <cite>Plan B 1.0</cite> has raised the estimated annual cost of protective measures from G$31 to G$45. Still, the annual benefits are appraised at T$4&ndash;5. Despite the 100:1 return on investment &mdash; rather more than is usually available &mdash; this is of no interest to our financial sector, because the return is distributed across the world and into the future. Much of the return appears as avoidance of costs, rather than anything bankable. It is the sort of investment one makes, thinking to leave a better world for his children. The immediate cost &mdash; part of which is creating land and sea reserves to remove critical regions from commercial exploitation &mdash; will be seen by the short-sighted as unwarranted interference with their god-given right of pillage (Gen. 1:26).
</p>

<p><cite>Plan B</cite> is optimistic in several respects, but this is not the place for details. It does, however, cover the  matter of global heating rather lightly.

</h2>

<p>Arne Naess, who gave us the concept of Deep Ecology in 1973, spent a week in April of 1984 camping in Death Valley with George Sessions, during which they set out basic principles which may have been startling to people at the time, but which seem pretty obvious today:
</p>

<ol>
<ul><br>The well-being and flourishing of life on Earth have value in themselves which are independent of the usefulness of the non-human world for human purposes.</ul>

<ul><br>Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.</ul>

<ul><br>Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy <i>vital needs</i>.</ul>

<ul><br>The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The  flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.  [This is the only point that needs comment. The idea of reducing the human population is so contrary to both our DNA (read <i>sex drive</i>) and culture, that this principle has gotten Deep Ecology called &lsquo;fascist&rsquo; and &lsquo;hateful toward humanity&rsquo; by the innumerate. A little thought shows that the sustainable population of the Earth is ~3 billion. How do we know this? Because the world population up to 1910, when the oil age began, was a smooth solar-supported logistic which looks as though it would level off at <a href="../_E/E20.shtml#F20.16">this number</a>. See <a href="#F22.6">Fig. 22.6</a> for the only approach proposed so far to increase the sustainable number.</ul>

<ul><br>Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.</ul>

<ul><br>Policies must therefore be changed.  These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures.  The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.</ul>

<ul><br>The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.</ul>

<ul><br>Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.</ul>

</ol>

<p>The <a class="fn">superficial problem<span>
	The deep problem is how one persuades a person connected to the real world only through the stock market that facts and data and logic are important, <i>even when they disagree with the market</i>. We failed, dramatically, to do this in 1929 (and a few of them withdrew from gene pool, but too late to do much good) and consistently since ~1970, and I haven&apos;t a clue how to deal with this problem. Like most scientists, I carry on with facts and data and logic and hope that some rubs off. It&apos;s a frustrating job, leading jackasses to water!
</span></a> is shown in Fig. 22.1. The data is noisy, which makes it very hard to see small trends. The modeller&apos;s response is to separate noise from signal, which can be done by subtracting 2 simple equations from the &lsquo;climate&rsquo; data on the left, leaving the &lsquo;weather&rsquo; data on the right.

	Moral: <i>Ignore advertizing</i>. If corporations were persons they’d be incarcerated as dangerous sociopaths. By the end of 2015, it became apparent that Big Oil had long known a great deal about global heating, and had chosen to lie about it. So far, no Boards of Directors have faced a firing squad for this, but I don&apos;t know why not.

<p>An 0.8°C (0.3%) increase in mean temperature might seem insignificant, but it represents a <a class="fn">2 W/m<sup>2</sup> (0.8%) additional<span>

</span></a> energy input to the earth&apos;s surface, and a non-steady-state distribution of that energy. The ocean moves heat poleward in concentrated surface currents (e.g., the Gulf Stream); the return flow is by cold deep water, but melting ice makes the surface of polar seas less dense and inhibits the return flow. The atmosphere moves heat from the tropics to the upper atmosphere, where it can radiate to space. The concomitant to moving hot moist air poleward is moving cold dry air equatorward. Planetary rotation complicates the process, and is largely responsible for weather. Storms are a consequence of this energy transport; increase the energy to be moved, and established weather patterns change and winds increase. The temperate zone does not see a steady rise in mean temperature, but higher-energy storms. The result is that the details of climate change are unpredictable and often counter-intuitive (where I live, we had a year&apos;s rainfall last month). This randomness makes it possible for the financially interested to deny that anything new is happening.
<p>

<p>As one &lsquo;unrelated&rsquo; consequence, shifting rainfall will exacerbate a problem whose primary cause is simple overpopulation. People fight wars over water, and water tables are sinking in all of the world&apos;s major aquifers: in some cases there is no recharge (Yemen), and in others extraction is 100 times recharge (parts of the Ogallala). On your next summer overflight of the Ogallala (which extends from South Dakota to Texas), notice the acre-sized &lsquo;crop circles&rsquo; created by center-pivot sprinklers, and contemplate &lsquo;increasing efficiency of water use&rsquo; by a factor of 100 &mdash; given that the sprinklers are considered a water-conserving method. Present urgency and forethought are such that &lsquo;increased oversight and regulation of the aquifer by the federal government does not appear to be forthcoming&rsquo; {Wikipedia}. The Great Lakes watershed authorities have problems of their own and do not welcome ideas about recharging the Ogallala from their lakes.

<p>Ameliorating global heating will cost money. It will generate business opportunities for some, and reduce them for others. Consequently, much tobacco-style FUD is aimed at the interpretation of  temperature proxies such as tree rings, marine sediments, ice cores, coral reefs, stalactites, &amp;c. In particular, there were indignant claims that the Medieval Warm Period (c. 950&ndash;1250) was just as hot as today (not true), so all is well (not true). The rationale seems to be this:
</p>

<blockquote>If we can just ignore the data, global heating will go away. Let us declare paleothermometry to be junk science and the Weather Bureau (and 100 other research centers) incompetent. They are obviously doing what we were taught in our expensive MBA courses: spread fear and lies to keep the research money rolling in.
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, each paleothermometer presents unique subtleties and is subject to confounding influences. This is why professionals devote their careers to testing and refining techniques and interpretations.
</p>

<p>Granted, the Weather Bureau cannot predict weather 2 weeks in advance, because the atmosphere is chaotic and weather happens at random in the right half of Fig. 22.1. This is why we focus on the smooth curve drawn through the left half of the figure.
</p>

<p>A typical denialist complaint is that it was not long ago that climate scientists were predicting another ice age. Now they‘re predicting heat waves, so obviously they don&apos;t know what they are talking about. (Denialists are uncomfortable with change, but clearly on speaking terms with fraud, since it is the first thing they think of to explain the erratic progress of science.) If you look at the temperature-vs-time curves from the 4 km of ice at Vostok in Antarctica, you see Fig. 22.2, with a sawtooth curve and a steep rise at the beginning of an interglacial, followed by a slow cooling into the next ice age. (There are now ice cores from 3 dozen sites, showing both general agreement and interesting local variation.) The sawtooth pattern was news in 1999 when it was <a class="fn">first published.<span>
	JR Petit &amp;18a (1999) &lsquo;Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica&rsquo; <cite>Nature</cite> <b>99</b>: 429&ndash;436; doi:10.1038/20859
</span></a> Checking their algorithms against this new data, climate models suggested that by now, 12,000 years since the initiation of the interglacial, the climate should have cooled enough so that eastern Canada would be accumulating ice once again. Hence the concept of a new ice age <i>90,000 years down the road</i>.

Vostok Temperature Data. The accumulation of ice begins as soon as insolation and the greenhouse between them are too weak to melt all of the winter&apos;s ice during the summer, approximately at the 0 line of temperature difference. The earlier ice ages suggested that we should be seeing year-old snow in eastern Canada by now, and the some climate models agreed. This is not happening, so our interglacial is not like the previous ones. Why not?
</figcaption></figure>


<p>But Canada is obviously <i>not</i> accumulating ice &mdash; and here we come to one of those situations that partition the world into 2 kinds of people: in this case, those who say, &lsquo;That&apos;s odd! I wonder what&apos;s happening?&rsquo;, and go to the laboratory or the field or the literature or the web to find out; and those who seize upon this as proof that the enterprise of trying to understand the world is Faustian and the work of the devil.

<p>In 2003, <a class="fn">Ruddiman<span>
	WF Ruddiman (2003) &lsquo;The Anthropogenic Greenhouse Era Began Thousands of Years Ago&rsquo; <cite>Climatic Change</cite> <b>61</b>: 261&ndash;293.
</span></a> suggested that land clearance for Neolithic agriculture, beginning 8000 years ago, had injected enough anthropogenic greenhouse gases to make our interglacial different from the prototypes &mdash; a hypothesis he himself described as &lsquo;provocative and controversial&rsquo;, although I don&apos;t see why. Figure 22.3 shows the expected and actual changes in methane over the period in question, with methane being about 200 times more effective than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas. The graph for CO₂ shows a similar change of direction starting 8000 years ago.

Early Methane. Ruddiman noticed that CO₂ began inceasing ~8000 years ago, when we started clearing European forests for agriculture. Methane began increasing ~5000 years ago, when the Chinese started making rice paddies. (The dip labelled &lsquo;YD&rsquo; is the Younger Dryas, a millennial  cold dry period whose origin remains unexplained. Neither asteroid impact nor vulcanism appears to be responsible.) The coupling between low-latitude insolation and methane is probably through monsoon rains and lowland floods (stagnant water being a common source of methane). In short, Ruddiman suggests that we began changing the climate long before the Industrial Revolution.

	D‘J Aleo, A Watts (2010) &lsquo;Surface Temperature Records: Policy‐Driven Deception?’ <cite>SPPI Original Paper</cite> 2010-08-27 http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/originals/policy_driven_deception.html (2010-09-13),
</span></a> claims that instrumental records suffer from urban heat islands, land-use change, relocation of stations, missing data, poorly placed thermometers, and undocumented &lsquo;adjustments&rsquo; that have left a record with a warming bias and no reliable way to correct it. The subphrase of its title, &lsquo;Policy-based deception?&rsquo;, strongly suggests psychological projection of the authors&apos; own <i>modus operandi</i>. The paper is part of a long carping suite of disinformation from the Heartland Institute, a raucous denier of climate change supported by and speaking for the <a class="fn">Koch coal billionaires.<span>
	Who, be it noted, would not be billionaires if they paid miners a living wage.
</span></a> In contrast to the FUD, careful analysis showed a slight <i>cooling</i> bias in US data, corresponding not to the suggested problems, but to the replacement of mercury thermometers by thermistors. This bias was removed by pairwise comparisons of trend lines spanning the period of replacement. The US Climate Reference Network (with some duplicate stations and triply redundant instrumentation) shows intercomparison uncertainties comparable to the precision of thermistors, in the <a class="fn">millikelvin<span>

<p>&lsquo;Figures don&apos;t lie, but liars do figure&rsquo;. Here are some misleading things one could truthfully say about Fig. 22.1:</p>

<ul>
<li> The mean temperature was the same in 1926 and 1978.</li>
<li> 1944 was the hottest year of the [or &lsquo;a&rsquo;] century.</li>
<li> The record shows 60 years of mean temperature decrease.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu"> &mdash; and none of them changes the 0.8°C rise.
</p>

<p>Nor does the conservative FUD change the reality of global heating. &lsquo;Climate sceptics&rsquo;, apparently terrified of taxes, regulation, and loss of business, continue to exaggerate imaginary failings in the hope of discrediting scientists who study global heating. Accordingly, we look at a pair of indirect records whose data and interpretation &mdash; while still subtle &mdash; are independent, based on different techniques, and are perhaps more persuasive to the by-stander. These are the loss of Arctic sea ice and Antarctic land ice.

<p>The loss of ice is unarguable. Antarctic land-ice loss is accelerating at the rate of 28 Gtons/yr², as shown by the parabolic green trend line in Fig. 22.4. (The red line smooths seasonal variability.) Unlike the melting of Arctic sea ice, this loss contributes directly to sea-level rise.

to say:
</p>

<blockquote>Current global model studies project that the Antarctic Ice Sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and is expected to gain in mass due to increased snowfall.
</blockquote>

<p>This did not happen, and perversely, Antarctic <i>sea</i> ice is <i>increasing</i>. Poorly informed sceptics misinterpret this to deny global heating and display the incompetence of scientists, but the projection was from models that did not include circumpolar fluid thermodynamics with <a class="fn">sufficient subtlety.<span>
	Just as a truly accurate map would be the same size as the terrain it represents, a truly accurate model would run as slowly as the real world. Each model now has thousands of hours of development time behind it, endeavoring to incorporate what its creators believe are the most important processes in realistic (and efficient) algorithms. The best way to appreciate the problems is to get involved. Laptops now have the capacity to run the super-computer models of the 1970s, so you could run your own first-order model. Even better, the Climateprediction.net runs a distributed computing project to which anyone with a home computer can contribute. They have run over 80,000,000 model years on 50,000 contributing personal computers, with an increasingly sophisticated series of global climate models.

</span></a> Warmer water north of the Antarctic Convergence evaporates. Naïvely expected to increase precipitation on the land mass, it instead snows out before it reaches the coast, creating a fresh-water input that reduces the salinity and density of surface seawater, while raising its freezing point and increasing its vertical stability. This produces a cold, thin, quickly frozen surface layer. The present balance (not necessarily permanent) results in more sea ice. (After all, &lsquo;warming&rsquo; in Antarctica can mean going from -20°C to -17°C, and ice still forms.)
</p>

<p>The major concern in Antarctica is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Ice sheets are what glaciers turn into when they hit the ocean, and their size is a balance between glacial input and ice-edge calving of icebergs and melting. The Larsen A Ice Shelf (at the warm end of West Antarctica) collapsed in  1995, the adjacent Larsen B, about the size of Rhode Island, having been stable for 12,000 years, disintegrated in 3 summer weeks of 2002. The Ross Ice Shelf, about the size of France, showed signs of instability by May 2014. Its disintegration would not raise sea level (because it is floating ice), but it would unblock the glaciers that feed it, which have the mass to raise sea level by 3 meters in, say, <a class="fn">a century.<span>
	This, incidentally, is why I built my house at 250 m above sea level, instead of down by the beach at the end of my river, with its warm water, interesting marine life, and topless girls. Glacial surges have been known to outrun people, and there is a high-water mark in the Thames Valley which appears to be the result of an Antarctic ice surge.

<p>Another observation which undermines the attempts of climate sceptics to deny global heating comes from the biological world. By 2002, <a class="fn">Walther<span>
	G-R Walther &amp;8a (2002) &lsquo;Ecological responses to recent climate change&rsquo; <cite>Nature</cite> <b>416</b>: 369&ndash;395.

</span></a> Systems such as bird reproduction in which one component responds to day length (migration) and another to temperature (insect food for nestlings) are confused: evolution will be rapid here. Heat- and drought-resistant alleles have spread into populations that never needed them.
</p>

<p>One of the more striking examples is the circumpolar Arctic walrus. Normally, walruses use ice floes to rest, sleep, raise their young, and scan the bottom for molluscs. By October of 2014 there was <a class="fn">so little<span>

<p>In other words, <b>those who know what is going on have been adjusting for decades.</b> (Oddly, this includes trees and bugs &mdash; but not bankers, CEOs, or politicians.) The world of nature is exquisitely aware of what is happening &lsquo;out there&rsquo;, posessing a perspective known only to humans who are similarly in touch with the real world &mdash; bird-watchers, backpackers, gardeners, ecologists, field biologists, climatologists, and their ilk. Climate-change deniers are people who subsist in heated/air-conditioned space, unaware of reality. They are so insulated from the natural world that we might well call them &lsquo;denatured&rsquo;. In biological terms, they are non-adaptive. In the absence of technology (and the financial ability to protect themselves artificially), they would be the first to succumb to natural change. They are dead fossils walking. Unfortunately, we are letting them take the rest of us with them.

It is astonishing that no intelligent, forward-thinking, socially indispensible paragons of entrepreneurial capitalists has had the wit to build one for himself.  A national commitment to such a project should (like a moon landing) generate enough cost overruns and boondoggles to satisfy corporate interests, and unlike the MIC wars, actually accomplish something useful.

	The Coulomb repulsion between the proton and the nickel nucleus is too large for this reaction under any conditions  known in the universe, including the interior of stars. No one has written an equation for a low-energy nuclear reaction. There is talk of neutron and helium production, but no gamma rays (emitted by all known nuclear reactions), no plausible reactions and no repeatable results.

</span></a> (who coined the term &lsquo;global warming&rsquo; in 1975) suggested that we could remove CO₂ directly from the atmosphere by chemical reaction with common rocks. The problem is one of scale: this requires a larger industrial plant than coal mining and power generation together. The US produced 1.8 gigatons of CO₂ in 1999, or 5 megatons/day from 1.35 Mt of coal. Experimental CO₂-removal reactors run at 185°C and 150 atmospheres, using <a class="fn">powdered rock<span>

</span></a>. This is a daily need for mining, transporting, pulverizing, heating, and processing 13 megatons of rock, adding 6 megatons of water, and disposing of 24 megatons of magnesium carbonate and silica slurry (moving 29 tons for every ton of coal).
</p>

<p>Another approach separates CO₂ from flue gas and injects it into exhausted oil fields, where it can force more oil to the surface, allowing us to increase CO₂ production even further.

<p>The 700-page <a class="fn"><cite>Stern Report</cite><span>
	Sir Nicholas Stern (2006) <cite>Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change</cite> (HM Treasury, London).
<br>----------------------<br>
	I find a number of the <cite>Report&apos;s</cite> assumptions quite optimistic, but one example will suffice: Fig. 7.8, &lsquo;Availability of Oil by Price&rsquo;, plots oil consumed and oil still available in 2004 dollars. It shows that we have used a trillion barrels at $20/bbl (the cyan volume of Fig. 20.10) OPEC has another trillion at $15 (the red volume), a 3rd trillion is waiting at $25 (the green volume) &mdash; and only then does the price jump. Deep-water and Arctic oil, plus heavy oil and bitumen take us to 4.5 trillion bbl at prices below $60, and oil shale takes us to 5.5 trillion bbl at $70 (the yellow volume) &mdash; including costs to make these fuels comparable in CO₂ emission to conventional fuel.<br> In the real world, oil price hit $147/bbl before the <cite>Stern Report</cite> reached me (ie, during the $15 period!), and after a brief remission, is rising toward that value again. I do not think I am pessimistic, but in the early 70s, when my audience was reeling from $30/bbl, I predicted that they would live to see $300/bbl. Indeed, an IMF working paper led to a headline reading &lsquo;Oil Prices May Double&rsquo; [from $113/bbl] {<cite>GW</cite> 2012-05-18 p18).
</span></a> &mdash; independent of the IPCC &mdash; initially concluded that the cost of &lsquo;reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change&rsquo; would be 1% of the GWP. However, the 1% would disproportionately reduce the income of the &lsquo;elite&rsquo;, and the initial costs of global heating fall upon what are commonly called &lsquo;useless eaters&rsquo;. Some see this as a benefit, overlooking the irreversible, global nature of the process, so nothing has happened. (The later costs, when mitigation will have no effect, will fall on developed countries and cities.)
</p>

<p>Delay can raise the cost above 20% of GWP &lsquo;now and forever&rsquo;, as sketched in Fig. 22.7. It is expensive to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and the number of problems increases rapidly with warming. (A new one is coastal erosion of, and salinity intrusion into, the agricultural Nile Delta as sealevel rises {<cite>GW</cite> 2009-09-18. p25} &mdash; in a nation so unsustainable that it already imports half its food.) Stern suggested in late 2009 that the cost had risen to 2% of GWP {<cite>GW</cite> 2009-09-18 p17}, already above the black curve of Fig. 22.7. Unfortunately, Fig. 22.7 provides all the incentive some need to postpone action until the curves cross. The only effective response to the political argument, &lsquo;We‘ll be dead by then: why pay for something that won&apos;t benefit us?’ is political death now, by a recall election. Or some faster method.

<p>Economists&apos; commonly minimize future values by &lsquo;discounting&rsquo;. As nearly as I can tell by examining events in my own lifetime, this is both unrealistic and unethical.

	Swedish, with a cool wooden handle, so not quite a direct replacement. To my surprise, cheaper steel (embossed with ridges which shield most of the area from tools like pancake turners) provides the same superior non-stick qualities as cast iron. That is, when &lsquo;seasoned&rsquo; by heating a thin coat of oil to 230&ndash;260°C (straw to light brown tempering color) it grows a monolayer of iron stearate/palmitate/whatever (saturated oils seem to work best) to which even barnacles can&apos;t stick &mdash; although they adhere to high-tech alumina/teflon &lsquo;non-stick&rsquo; surfaces. The thicker cast-ion still provides a more uniform cooking surface.
</span></a>) and the cheaper &lsquo;high-tech&rsquo; versions are inferior. Recycled, 100-year old, hand-carved furniture beats Ikea on esthetics, utility, price, durability, and repairability. In other words, in life as I live it, the future value of real items often <i>exceeds</i> their present value. Every item that I have claimed householder insurance on has been over-depreciated by the adjuster (a small sample, but sufficient so that I usually prefer to &lsquo;self-insure&rsquo;).

<p>So too with climate change. The future costs (of action or inaction) will be, <i>and be seen as</i>, larger than the present costs.

<p>The <i>fact</i> of global heating may be well established, but the <i>cause</i> is not quite so certain. The details above are based on 20 years of work by some 800 researchers and 2500 reviewers. Received wisdom has been that climate is the product of many influences. As is evident from Fox &lsquo;News&rsquo;, a major, if illogical, complaint of the &lsquo;climate deniers&rsquo; is that all of the predictions of future change are based on computer models instead of data. Ignoring the difficulty of obtaining future data in time to make use of it, the important feature is that <b>until one can model climate, one cannot pretend to understand it</b>. Our current grasp of short-term effects is shown by the detailed agreement of the orange and black lines in the upper graph of Fig. 22.8.

<p>The frequent statement by climate deniers, that they &lsquo;haven&apos;t seen any data&rsquo;, may mean that they don&apos;t want to look, that they lack the analytic ability to read Fig. 22.8, or that they do not understand that &lsquo;Anthropogenic effects&rsquo; is synonymous with &lsquo;fossil-fuel CO₂&rsquo;.

Start with a warm interglacial climate like today&apos;s, but without anthropogenic CO₂ input. Phytoplankton slowly but steadily draw down atmospheric CO₂, die, increase organic carbon in sediments, and thence methane clathrates. The gradual loss of atmospheric CO₂ cools the climate, with (as the models show) major effect in the arctic zones. Milankovitch willing, land ice accumulates, sea level drops, but exposed Arctic-basin sediments are cold enough to preserve the methane ice. The process continues until sea-level fall has exposed several hundred vertical meters of clathrate-rich sediments on continental shelves and slopes. This situation is thermodynamically metastable; all it needs now is a Milankovitch insolation peak to produce a warm Arctic summer, and it releases a 50-kyr accumulation of a greenhouse gas with many times the warming potential of CO₂. This methane pulse will <i>not</i> be trapped in air bubbles in the ice, because methane is oxidized to CO₂ in a few years, and summer temperatures at the beginning of the interglacial &mdash; as in Greenland currently &mdash; would melt <a class="fn">winter accumulation<span>
	Iceland is losing 10 feet of glacier length annually. Even Naimona&apos;ny, a glacier at 6000 m in the Himalayas, and typical of the headwaters of the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra, has lost 70 years of accumulated ice from its <i>surface</i>. (High-altitude glaciers used to melt from the low end, as in Iceland &mdash; constantly replenished by slow downhill movement &mdash; and not from the surface. Surface ablation means that the atmospheric isotherms have moved upwards. See Fig. 22.12 in appendix 22b.) The end result of this process is extreme erosion of the upland valleys, devastating floods and silting during the summer monsoon, winter drought throughout India, Southeast Asia, and China, and 2 billion desperate and angry people. If we are lucky, they will only nuke eachother.<br><br>

	Such events would not be called &lsquo;subtle&rsquo; except for their ability to escape the notice of the people we elect to government.

<p>Modelling this hypothesis would be a full time project that would compete with this book, so I content myself with describing it. It accounts nicely for the rise of temperature before CO₂, for the sawtooth nature of the isotopic temperature record, and it offers a plausible driver for the 100-kyr glaciation cycle. The fact that methane is currently escaping from Arctic sediments might seem contradictory: Why did it not all boil off 12,000 years ago at the start of the interglacial? All I can suggest is that additional warming from the 100 ppm of anthropogenic CO₂ is reaching deeper into the permafrost, again making this interglacial different from all others.

<p>Loss of polar ice shelves is sufficient to prevent bottom-water formation and ventilation of the deep ocean.

	Greenland lost some 370 km<sup>2</sup> of coastal ice shelves between 2009 and 2012. Melting of the surface of its land ice (as suggested below) has removed any record of recent atmospheric gas concentrations.

<p>The first 4 extinctions were caused by climate change. We might want to minimize global heating lest the 6th take us with it. Climate-change deniers will point out that deep-sea ventilation is a myriennial process, so there is time to <i>make</i> money, rather than spend it &mdash; but what is the (evolutionary) point of making money if so doing destroys your descendants?

<p>There is already a clarion call for the Gaian requirement in religion, although it was not named that, and its fundamental religious nature was not always mentioned. The need for a working cooperation with the world of nature was understood 1800 years ago. It has been nurtured by philosophers, rabbis, cosmologists, paleontologists, historians, landscape architects, and others.
</p>

<p>The destructive influence of Christianity&apos;s anthropocentric and other-worldly focus was clearly seen by the Neoplatonist Porphyry, c. 300 CE. He was the first professional philosopher to write about actually defended nature prior to the 20th century. Not coincidentally, his 15-volume work (known only from quoted excerpts) was titled <cite>Against the Christians</cite>. Jesus, with his reputed treatment of the pigs {Matt 8:30ff} and figs {Matt 21:19ff}, set a bad example. Paul, with an unconcern so deep it is most politely called ignorance, set Christianity on the wrong road. Needing to keep his flock from being a minor Jewish heresy, he saw nothing of value in the Old Testament save prophecies which could be twisted into prefiguring Jesus. He overlooked the work of Isaiah, who anticipated Porphyry by 1000 years. Intent upon creating a need for his Gnostic Redeemer, he warped the stories of Genesis, missing their point and depriving Christianity of a much needed balance.

NEPA mandated them to consider the &lsquo;relationship between short-term use of [the] environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity&rsquo;, the &lsquo;irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of &hellip; ecosystems&rsquo;.

	&bull; ECUADOR (2008) says nature &lsquo;has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution.&rsquo; This right, the constitution states, &lsquo;is independent of the obligation on natural and juridical persons or the State to indemnify the people that depend on the natural systems.&rsquo;<br>

<p>The premonitions and insights of the preceding statements were scattered and diffuse. The first attempt to synthesize them into a coherent stance was not made until 1991, when the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the <a class="fn">
	International Union for the Conservation of Nature<span> IUCN, UNEP, WWF (1991) <cite>Caring for the Earth, A Strategy for Sustainable Living</cite> (Gland, Switzerland).</span></a>
(IUCN), belatedly called for a dialog:
</p>

<blockquote>Our survival depends on the use of other species, but it is a matter of ethics, as well as practicality, that we ensure their survival and safeguard their habitats.<br>

Four actions are needed to implement this principle, [of which the first is]:<br><br>

&bull; The ethic for sustainable living should be developed by a dialog between religious leaders, thinkers, leaders of society, citizens&apos; groups and all caring people. &hellip; The product of this action should be a clear and universally accepted statement of the principles of human conduct within the <a class="fn">world of nature<span>
	What we have learned since has enabled people to put probability limits on events and cost estimates, but they are still very wide limits. A few new threats have been identified, but the bottom line is that none of the problems then identified have been addressed.

<p>This little booklet was at least circulated to quangos on the UN mailing list &mdash; but nothing happened in response. By 1995, no one I could reach in the 3 agencies which produced it had heard of this publication. Yet international standards associations have decades of experience with orchestrating the definition and acceptance of similar statements. We know exactly how to go about doing what was called for &mdash; and is still needed. Standardization of software, aircraft safety, weather reporting, screw threads, and other utilities incidental to civilization, is a complex and painstaking process, involving meetings around the world, interim reports, and consultations with everyone concerned, over a decadal period &mdash; but it is a known process, itself almost standardized. For practices essential to survival, you‘d think we might manage as much.
</p>

<p>I suspect that the abject failure of IUCN, UNEP, and WWF to follow up on their call was not normal burocratic bungling, but was the direct result of malign pressure by the feudofascists
who profit from <a class="fn">unsustainable exploitation<span>
	WWF has a long history of temporizing in the hope of being seen as reasonable and considerate of the profit motive. In 19&bull;&bull; it fired a &bull;&bull; because he gathered evidence of illegal sales of ocelot-skin coats (banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). WWF failed to prosecute the business involved. Many field workers are openly contemptuous of its conciliatory approach, which they find ineffectual.

<p>This is deliberate policy: second-degree murder (&lsquo;with malice aforethought, but not premeditated&rsquo;), which normally carries a penalty of 30 year imprisonment. Convicting a few CEOs or board members as accessories before the fact (which carries the same penalty) should make murder a less popular management tool.

<p>The amount of this unsustainable profit is over T$2 annually, 1/3 of the profits of the world&apos;s top 3000 companies {<cite>GW</cite> 2010-02-22}. &lsquo;Fixing&rsquo; this will reduce managerial pay and increase the cost of doing business, and also affect everyone whose pension is in any way related to the performance of the stockmarket. But what if it reduced profits by 2/3? We would still be ahead of the game. Given the incentive, we could make up the difference with a more intelligent economic paradigm.
</p>

<p>I am not invoking a conspiracy here, but pointing out that the existing economic paradigm involves a real, vicious, and single-minded policy devoted to maintaining that excessive profit until the ecosystem that produces it collapses. One of its public faces is the propaganda mill with the Orwellian name &lsquo;Wise Use&rsquo;, but any major corporation has motive, means, and opportunity to protect its interests &mdash; together with a long-range vision extending to its next quarterly report, a corporate mentality of &lsquo;greed is good&rsquo;, a management which accepts whatever will increase profit, and a morality which makes &lsquo;business ethics&rsquo; an oxymoron. When <a href="F23.shtml#21a">SLAPPs</a> fail, flattery, bribery, intimidation, character assassination, subversion, murder, arson, car bombings, and rape, are (given plausible deniability) effective <a class="fn">management tools<span>

<p>As a result, the &lsquo;clear and universally accepted statement of the principles of human conduct within the world of nature&rsquo; was never enunciated. Global heating, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are the most prominent consequences, and we haven&apos;t begun to understand the dislocations, costs, deaths, famines, environmental refugees, and mass migrations which we cannot now prevent.

It opened with an example of the sort beloved of quangos, showing that their efforts paid off. Religion succeeded where education, environmental quangos, legislation, and scientists had all failed to dissuade the Muslims of fishing villages along the East African coast from fishing with dynamite. Yet in a sense, this was a cooked example, because it depended upon a population that believed its priests implicitly, and &mdash; fortunately &mdash; it had priests who could understand the problem when scientists explained it in detail, and were also able to  discover that Allah had long since prohibited dynamiting the ocean.

<p>Again we come to frontier science, the attempt to recognize  planetary boundaries, and &mdash; drawing upon multidisciplinary  understanding &mdash; to quantify them. Like climate change (which presents one of the boundaries) this requires immense collaborative effort. Boundaries are not obvious, their effects are insidious, their consequences diffuse, and their causes impersonal. To individuals, they are not recognizable as either threats or things that can be changed. Avoidance requires precisely the feature that US Republicans think they were elected to abolish in 2015: governmental interference with individual liberty that prevents people from doing as they damned well please when the cumulative consequences are culture breaking.
<p>

<p>The ten planetary boundaries of Table 22.4 have so far been recognized. The idea of a boundary is that in each category, potential catastrophes lie ahead. In some cases their approach seems slow but inexorable; in others, possibly sudden and disastrous. Given Lao Tzu&apos;s startling observation that &lsquo;If we do not change direction, we may end up where we are heading&rsquo;, it seems smart to put a notional fence between us and the disasters. Since we know what worked during the Holocene (11,700 BCE&ndash;1760), a good bet is that we might be able to extend the Anthropocene (1760&ndash;??) indefinitely by maintaining conditions similar to those of the Holocene. Table 22.4 presents some boundaries we should not cross if we hope to do this. Note that every boundary is at least as complex as the discussion of global heating <a href="#04">above</a>.

Planetary Boundaries. Rockstr&ouml;m and his many coworkers did not mention Gaia (no doubt hoping to avoid contamination of good science with precautionary philosophy), but the calculated limits &mdash; subject always to better estimation as knowledge accumulates &mdash; are the sort of warnings Moses would bring down the hill carved in stone if Gaia were in charge. Considering the amount of effort that has gone into teaching climate change &mdash; and how little effect it has had on US Republicans, any church concerned with human welfare would be emphasizing personal salvation through active stewardship rather than blind faith.

<p class="epi">A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simpler system that works. &mdash; A commonplace of engineering.
</p>

<p>Throughout history observant people have seen complex systems working well in the natural world. Many interpret this as evidence of Intelligent Design (ID), and <b>conjecture</b> an Intelligent Designer. According to Cicero, &lsquo;<b>Anaxagoras</b> was the first to hold that the order and measure of all things was planned and accomplished by the power and intelligence of an infinite mind.&rsquo; This hypothesis was extensively explored by <b>Cicero</b> in 45 BCE, and has been revived many times since. In 2 millennia no one has found a way to advance the hypothesis beyond the bare statement, &lsquo;Parts of the universe look as though they had been designed&rsquo;. <b>Lucretius</b> added, &lsquo;And many of them are very poorly designed&rsquo;. <b>Helmholtz</b> came to the same conclusion.
</p>

<p>There is no way to falsify ID, so by <b>Popper&apos;s</b> definition, it lies outside the reach of science. It is also an <b>undecidable question</b>. This is not unusual, because <b>Gödel</b> showed (in an easily understandable proof) that such questions can be asked but not answered within any formal system. The reason that scientists dismiss ID is that it has not been a fertile paradigm. ID was the only approach we had during the Dark Ages (400&ndash;1300 CE), and it led nowhere. Anything useful that it produced is already in the textbooks. No verified prediction has been based on ID, nor has it inspired significant research. When <b>William Paley&apos;s</b> <cite>Natural Theology</cite> (1802) described the Great Watchmaker, he was using the same argument disposed of by Cicero. 1600 years without a new idea suggests strongly that there is little to be gained from ID once the concept is acknowledged and filed away in case someone thinks of a way to falsify it.
</p>

<p>The mathematics of species evolution was done in 1930 by <b>R.A. Fisher</b>, combining <b>Mendel&apos;s</b> genetics and Darwin&apos;s <b>natural selection</b>. When the ID community can produce a book like Fisher&apos;s <cite>The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</cite> (that is, explaining in predictive mathematical detail the process of ID in the biological world), they will be taken seriously, and any consequential results that they then produce will be included in the text books as a matter of course. Until they can do this, they will be ignored.
</p>

<p>Some biological structures are so complex that removal of a single component causes system failure. The doctrine of &lsquo;Irreducible Complexity&rsquo; (IC) then conjectures that these &lsquo;cannot have been derived from simpler precursors&rsquo; and must have been created in completed form. This reveals a failure of analytic thinking and lack of imagination. <b>Darwin</b> mentioned that people would think of the <b>eye</b> like this. Then he suggested a series of simpler eyes that he thought could be found among animals. These have been found in 4 different phyla. Every IC candidate has been shown by biologists to have a series of earlier, simpler forms with fewer components, in the manner of any household device.
</p>

<p>Proponents of ID admit &lsquo;micro-evolution&rsquo; to account for the variability of, say, the domestic dog. Otherwise, the catchall term &lsquo;kind&rsquo; in Genesis has to accommodate 10 million species in 7 groups. The process that admits &lsquo;micro-evolution&rsquo; but prevents the evolution of new species is the so-called ‘<b>species barrier</b>’. This has never been described in molecular detail. While many processes that contribute to biological evolution are understood only at the handwaving level, the simplest &mdash; point mutation &mdash; is well known. Before ID/IC can compete with evolutionary theory, it must explain the &lsquo;species barrier&rsquo; wiinth the same mechanistic detail. Here is a clear, simple test &mdash; and one that is resolutely ignored. <b>Margulis&apos;s</b> horizontal gene transfer by <b>endosymbiosis</b> is an important addition to Fisher&apos;s synthesis, and directly contradicts a species barrier.
</p>

<p>Before ID can be taken seriously, we have to understand the consequences of <b>Jolly&apos;s</b> hypothesis of <b>Machiavellian intelligence</b> that enables us to deduce what other people might be thinking, and why &lsquo;We cannot help but see design and purpose wherever there is complexity or beauty.’
</p>

<p>ID is such a simple idea that it is a central feature of most <b>creation myths</b>. Anthropologists estimate that there have been 100,000 of these. Most were lost before the invention of writing. Still, we have several hundred such stories. (Genesis contains 2, or at least one and a large fragment.) Many of them are entertaining and not without literary merit.
</p>

<p>The IC and ID conjectures take us far from the central interest of [whatever specific topic is being covered]. Today they belong to the history of philosophy, for they have not contributed directly to [our subject]. Anyone emotionally wedded to them is encouraged to pursue one of the bold-face topics above as a term paper/class project.

<p>In a few short paragraphs, the concept of &lsquo;intelligent design&rsquo; has provided the basis for over a dozen major classroom projects. Anaxagoras, Cicero, Lucretius, Helmholtz, Popper, Gödel, Paley, Fisher, Mendel, Darwin, and Jolly can all be understood at many levels, and it is never too early to begin. Helmholtz was both physicist and optician. Why did he think the eye so poorly designed? What other examples of inept design are there? What Darwin actually said is little known, but needs to be, and <cite>Origin of Species</cite> is easy reading. (Fisher is not for the faint hearted or mathematically unprepared. He practically invented statistics, and was the equal of Gauss and Laplace as a mathematician. But his summary of his work is straightforward: &lsquo;Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability&rsquo;.) The idea of preventing evolution is a fertile one. Why is it needed by ID? How might it be implemented? Why is it so difficult to do? Machiavellian intelligence is an important part of being human. With whom do we share it? What does it do that is useful? What does it do that might not be useful? Comparative mythology offers numerous suggestions of intelligent (and not so intelligent) design, embedded in stories of varying plausibility. How can these stories be classified? Why do we choose to believe one and not another?</p>
<hr>

<p>(Critics who might respond &lsquo;That&apos;s not what we mean by &hellip;!&rsquo; should be invited to offer relevant examples <i>and ways to test them</i>. Perhaps compelling the suggester to propose a test which would falsify his example will have salutary results? It could happen.)
</p>

<p>A competent teacher will have no trouble devoting one class period to ID/IC at any level from 5th grade to graduate-school seminars, based on suitable modification of the above paragraphs.
