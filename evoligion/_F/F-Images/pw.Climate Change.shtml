<p class="epi">You almost couldn't design a problem that is a worse fit 
with our underlying psychology. Climate change is not immediate, its 
causes are invisible, its consequences seem unrelated, and it is 
faceless. It has none of the features that evolution has taught us to 
recognize as a threat. — paraphrase of <a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/whats-the-best-way-to-communicate-about-climate-change-this-expert-offers-some-insights/">Anthony Leiserowitz</a>.
</p>

<p>Climate change includes numerous phenomena.
All of them come from an increase in the altitude of the Earth's 255°K 
(-1°F) radiation level. This temperature is governed by solar input and 
the albedo (reflectivity) of the Earth. Its altitude is controlled by 
the infrared optical depth, which depends upon ‘greenhouse gasses’. 
‘Greenhouse gasses’ are any molecules with more than 2 atoms. They have 
many internal energy levels that interact with infrared photons. This 
means that they decrease the optical depth, which raises the altitude of
 the radiation level, warms the Earth's surface, and changes our 
climate.

<p class="epi">For anyone who keeps up with the march of science, 
anthropogenic climate change was understood, anticipated, and 
noncontroversial a century ago:
</p>

<ul style="color:#066; font-size:smaller;">
<li>1824, Fourier: The atmosphere traps heat.</li>
<li>1861, Tyndall: Changes in CO₂ might explain climate change.</li>
<li>1896: Arrhenius outlines the effects of anthropogenic CO₂.</li>
<li>1936, Callendar: Doubling CO₂ will raise temperature 2°C.</li>
<li>1961, Keeling: Fossil-fuel use is steadily <a class="fn">increasing CO₂.<span>
	I was hired, fresh out of grad school, on Keeling's recommendation, 
because he intended that I should join his group as a post-doc. Roger 
Revelle thought I was too old for post-doc'ing and annointed me 
Assistant Professor. Keeling was doing first-rate science and the needed
 response was obvious, so it never occurred to me — imbued with the 
idealism and naïveté of the ivory tower — that something as banal as 
campaign contributions could keep the US from responding immediately and
 intelligently to a clear and present danger. I didn't see why Keeling 
needed me, so with interesting problems of my own lacking obvious 
answers I went my own way — thereby missing my chance to become a 
household name.
</span></a></li>

<li>7th-grade science known to everyone who has been paying attention:</li></ul>

<ul class="o5" style="color:#066; font-size:smaller;">
<li>Adding CO₂ increases the altitude from which infrared radiation can escape.</li>
<li>The radiation temperature of the Earth — a constant set by solar input — is at this altitude.</li>
<li>Below this altitude, temperature increases <a class="fn">adiabatically<span>
	‘Adiabatic’ means that no heat transfer is involved in raising the 
temperature. The increase comes from compressing the gas, so that the 
energy per unit volume increases.
</span></a> with <a class="fn">pressure.<span>
	Meteorologists routinely describe the troposphere as ‘well mixed’, 
despite the frequent optical evidence of large regions of finely divided
 condensed water floating around in it, and the layered appearance 
frequently found in altocumulus lenticularis clouds as the local air 
mass flows over a mountain. Still, the fact that the cloud stays put 
while the air flows through it shows that the temperature stratification
 remains in place while the air itself moves up and down.
</span></a></li>
<li>This is why snow is found on mountain tops and the Dead Sea is hot.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="color:#066; font-size:smaller;">
<li>1972, Sawyer: By 2000, CO₂ will increase by 25% and temperature by 0.6°C.</li>
<li>2003, Root: 1200 less intelligent species have responded to global heating by changing their behavior. <span class="rc">We are not among them. In fact, our ecocidal misbehavior is accelerating.</span></li>
<li>2016, Hansen: Children are suing the government for the harm they 
will endure if we continue to use fossil fuels. Defendant status was 
granted to three fossil-fuel-industry trade associations, representing 
nearly all of the world's largest fossil fuel companies, who called the 
case ‘a direct, substantial threat to our businesses’.</li>
<li>2017, Republicans finally  notice something is happening, and issue an apparently workable <a href="https://www.clcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheConservativeCaseforCarbonDividends.pdf">fiscal response,</a> possibly in time to do some good.
</li>
</ul>

<p>There was much we could have done with a century of advance warning  .
 The problem is that known, profitable business-as-usual always seems 
more important than precautions against unknown dangers. We cannot 
predict the detailed dangers of climate change except in the broadest 
terms. Despite the seminal paper mentioned in the epigraph, climate 
science is frontier science. It is perhaps the most complex problem that
 we have tackled. The number of disciplines that must be mastered is 
large. Their interactions (which produce the stochastic weather whose 
integration is climate) can be subtle and counterintuitive. The 
resulting uncertainty, together with Leiserowitz's epigraph and 
Congress's vested interests, explain why limiting CO<sub>2</sub> production is understood as an emergency priority by a few and a scam by many.
</p>

<p>We are fortunate that the simple model described here works as well 
as it does. Its many assumptions do not render it inaccurate, nor do its
 glaring omissions. Measuring the altitude of the ‘255°K radiation 
level’ is trivial. Predicting its future development is an abstraction 
of worldwide data about land-surface reflectivity, aerosol composition, 
cloud droplet size, concentration, and distribution, and gas-photon 
interactions, requiring 6-dimensional integration (3D spatial + 
composition + concentration + wavelength) over the spectrum of 
interactions (with light, and with eachother) of some 200 time-varying <a class="fn">chemical species.<span>
	I'm toying with a pseudo-mathematical formalism like this:<br>
	Climate = ∭∭∭∫ 𝕱(c,λ,I, θ,φ,z, a,o,t, 𝔛) dcdλdI dθdφdz dadodt d𝔛<br>
	Where the symbols, and limits of integration, are:<br>
	c, concentration of greenhouse gasses; over the range of radiatively active atmospheric constituents<br>
	λ, wavelength; across the radiation spectrum<br>
	I, radiation intensity; solar spectrum, seasonal variation<br>
	θ, latitude; pole to pole<br>
	φ, longitude; around the globe<br>
	z, altitude; throughout the atmosphere<br>
	a, heat transported by the atmosphere<br>
	o, heat transported by ocean currents<br>
	t, time; decadal to millennial, by day or hour<br>
	𝔛, whatever I’ve left out<br>     /
	𝕱, the forcing function; largely unknown, including quantum radiation 
process, anthropogenic chemical production, ocean circulation, etc, etc.
 — except that it is meaningless to the non-mathematical and the forcing
 function is, after all, equivalent to the ultimate Earth-System 
computer model.
</span></a> The art of making simple models is to learn what 
simplifications do not destroy utility. The model here I owe to a 
one-sentence explanation of climate change by Neil Donahue, Director of 
the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at 
Carnegie Mellon. The blunders are my own.
</p>

<p>Let me emphasize again that the heating is real. 1200 other species, 
more attuned to their environments than we are, have already altered 
their ranges, abundances, migration patterns, seasonal activities, and 
species interactions. Europe is now warmer than it has been for 5300 
years (if not 120,000 years). We know this because otherwise Ötzi the 
Ice Man would have thawed and decomposed. Climate is always changing. 
The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age (local European events) had 
something to do with vulcanism and the circulation of the North Atlantic
 Ocean. The Sahara has been grassland. Coastal areas, once well below 
sea level, today hold our most socially and technologicaly advanced 
cultures. Still, when we know that we are driving such changes, and when
 they spell trouble for agriculture, northward spread of tropical 
diseases, and flooding of coastal cities, does it not seem 
counterproductive to expedite them just to line the pockets of the 1%? 
(This is the only excuse I can find to explain the lack of Congressional
 action on climate change. What have I missed?)
</p>

<p>The <a class="fn">superficial problem<span>
	The deep problem is how one persuades a person connected to the real 
world only through the stock market that facts and data and logic are 
important, <i>even when they disagree with the market</i>. We failed, 
dramatically, to do this in 1929 (and a few of them withdrew from gene 
pool, but too late to do much good) and we have failed consistently 
since ~1970, and I haven't a clue how to deal with this problem. Like 
most scientists, I carry on with facts and data and logic and hope that 
some rubs off. It's a frustrating job, leading horses to water!
</span></a> is shown in Fig. 0. The data is noisy, which makes it very 
hard to see small trends. The modeller's response is to separate noise 
from signal, which can be done by subtracting 2 simple equations from 
the ‘climate’ data on the left, leaving the ‘weather’ data on the right.

Global Heating. <b>Left:</b> The smooth curve is the best-fit 
exponential. It closely matches anthropogenic CO₂ production, with about
 half of the CO₂ absorbed by and acidifying the ocean. The shaded 
oscillation (1900–1950) was first spotted by oceanographer <a class="fn">Wallace Broecker<span>
	WS Broecker (1975) ‘Man's oxygen reserve’ <cite>Science</cite> <b>189</b>: 460–463.</span></a>
at a time when Big Oil pretended that the heavy horizontal line (an 
80-year pseudo-stillstand) was real and claimed that the lack of 
increase between 1900 and, ultimately, the late 1970s, ‘proved’ that 
global heating <a class="fn">was not happening.<span>
	Moral: <i>Ignore advertizing</i>. If corporations were persons they'd 
be incarcerated as dangerous sociopaths. By the end of 2015, it became 
apparent that Big Oil had long known a great deal about global heating, 
and had chosen to lie about it. So far, no Boards of Directors have 
faced a firing squad for this, but I don't know why not.
</span></a> This was later admitted to have been a deliberate commercial
 lie, as their scientists were as competent as anyone's. After wartime 
ship records were <a class="fn">digitized<span>

No. 47 and an assessment of voluntary observing ship's observation 
heights in ICOADS’ <cite>J Atmos Ocean Technol</cite> <b>24</b>: 214–234.

 This is what would be happening in the absence of fossil-fuel 
consumption and Wally's Wiggle, (both removed by subtraction of simple 
equations, implying simple underlying processes). Some of the low points
 are associated with large volcanic eruptions.

<p>There are 2 important <a class="fn">temperatures<span>
	Just as there are 2 temperatures for the Earth, so too can a single 
molecule have 2 temperatures. This is important for thinking about the 
complexities of radiative transfer within the atmosphere. Its <i>thermometric</i> temperature, measured when it hits a solid object, is a function of its velocity. Its <i>bolometric</i>
 temperature, meaured by the radiation it emits, is a function of its 
electronic excitation, and these are only statistically in equilibrium.
</span></a> to consider in this discussion. The first is the radiation 
temperature of the Earth. Because energy is conserved (the First Law of 
Thermodynamics, and unlike human rules, a law that has never been 
observed to fail), energy leaving the Earth is equal to the energy it 
received from the sun. The energy is the same: the temperature of the 
energy is different because the receiving and exporting areas differ by a
 factor of 4, as shown in Fig. 1.

The Constant Radiation Temperature. The earth's steady-state <i>radiation</i> temperature depends upon 3 nearly invariant quantities: the incoming energy from the Sun, 1368±2 W/m<sup>2</sup>
 over the intercepted area; the fraction that is reflected (30±2%), and 
the emissivity of the earth (≈1). The reflected fraction, or albedo, 
amounts to some 400 W/m<sup>2</sup>, leaving 960 W/m<sup>2</sup> to be radiated by the spherical area. The <i>radiation</i> temperature of the earth is then 255°K (-18°C or -1°F). The mean <i>surface</i>
 temperature is 33°C warmer; this difference is the ‘greenhouse effect’,
 and it is set by the altitude of the radiation level. The 2 
temperatures differ by an average of  6.5°/km, the ‘atmospheric lapse 
rate’ (which varies as the humidity of the atmosphere varies). This puts
 the average radiation level close to 5 km.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>99% of the visible (short-wave) solar and infrared (long-wave) earth 
radiation — the orange and red outgoing arrows in Fig. 1 — lie on 
opposite sides of the 4-micron wavelenth, and so are easily separable by
 satellites.) The CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) 
satellite recorded a mean long-wave energy emission of 239 W/m<sup>2</sup>
 for 2009 (compared to the 240 of Fig. 1), showing that this simple 
model is right on target. The ‘radiative forcing’ responsible for the 
observed 0.8°C increase in mean surface temperature is calculated (to 1 
significant figure) in Table 0.

<p>The energy input is the 1368 W/m<sup>2</sup> of the solar constant 
measured at the top of the atmosphere, minus 30% for immediate 
reflection by clouds and snow cover, divided by 4 for the ratio of the 
areas of sphere and circle. Over the time period of interest, the 
maximum change in this number is 0.05 W/m<sup>2</sup>, which is insignificant compared to the 3 W/m<sup>2</sup> radiative forcing estimated in Table 0. This means that whatever is changing is internal to the earth's atmosphere.
</p>

<p>Table 0 is a bit misleading, because the energy increment is not an 
increase in incoming energy, but an eqivalent ‘forcing function’ which 
tells us how much additional energy would be required to replicate the 
effect of greenhouse gasses in raising the radiation level.
</p>

<p>We are looking at changes on the order of 1% in measured and calculated values. Intuition tells us that 1% is not an alarming
number. After all, the <a href="https://cognitiveinvesting.com/2012/01/17/how-much-fluctuation-should-i-expect-of-the-stock-market/">stock market</a>
 — the most important number in the life of the power elite — fluctuates
 by 5.6% over the course of a quarter, and that is just noise compared 
to the 9.25% expected annual profit. Why should we worry about 1% 
changes?
</p>

<p>Figure 2 was Britain's attempt to answer to that question.
</p><p>

</p><p>The simplest <a href="#19">linear extrapolation</a> of 
business-as-usual to the end of the 21st century leads to an immediate 
temperature rise of 6.4°C, off the scale of Fig. 2. One of the major 
criticism of the Stern Report was that it paid scant attention to 
adaptation (living with climate change, the only course that ‘realistic 
economists’ consider feasible). Unfortunately, a 6.4°C increase is not 
something that we are likely to adapt to. It is a culture breaker of the
 sort that has brought down 100 earlier cultures, catching them by 
surprise and leaving their ruins in the sand.

 of climate change, so we will probably get to observer these predicted

<p>The combination of frontier science and stochastic behavior makes the
 predictions of climatologists seem vague and unconvincing. It hasn't 
helped that

‘To date [mid 2016], the Koch brothers have given more than $88 million 
to groups who regularly attack and undermine climate science. And that's
 just what's traceable.’

Nor has it helped the public to understand the serious nature of what is
 happening, when the 3 main cable ‘news’ networks are unable, or 
unwilling, to report climate-related material accurately.
</p>


<p>Fox's errors are apparently financially motivated, by both network 
and speakers. CNN seems to have no axe to grind, but it still gives air 
time to those who do. MSNBC's mistakes are the ones we all make when 
records fall, even though there is no <i>direct</i> connection to known 
forcing agents. Climate scientists are touchy about this, because such 
direct connections are impossible to demonstrate. Experts are still 
exploring scores of small specialized models of subsystems that are not 
yet incorporated into the 40-odd Earth System Models (ESMs) running at 
various universities and climate centers. An ESM requires some hundred 
million calculations per simulated day. Climate, being the long-term 
integration of weather, requires simulations of 3-century periods, 
meaning months-long runs on the world's most powerful supercomputers. 
Only when aspects of the various models learn to agree (statistically) 
with eachother and with the data, do we begin to think that we 
understand those aspects of climate.

<p>I came across, on You Tube, a commentator who couldn't tell me what 
the Earth's mean temperature is, or what it would be in the absence of 
greenhouse gasses, if his life depended on it. Yet on national TV he 
feels competent to spew raucous, climate-change-denying FUD to an 
audience that appears to reach the halls of Congress, where 
Representative Joe Heck (NV), Senator Pat Toomey (PA), Senator Ron 
Johnson (WI) and others agree with him. He presents as rude 
(interrupting his guests), ignorant (unaware of the data), and stupid 
(impervious to rationality) — apparently because this appeals to his 
audience. Considering the millennial effects of global heating, any

<p>In the process, so much FUD and misinformation — both deliberate and

seems worthwhile to provide a reliable tutorial. Suffice it to say that I
 have no financial interest in the question, and am professionally 
competent in 2 or 3 of the score of disciplines involved. The climate 
scientists are doing the best they can, but — like anyone in the field —
 I can poke holes in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

 because the problem is so <a class="fn">complex,<span>
	Also, because it is basically an arm of the UN, the IPCC is 
constitutively incapable of thinking in terms of overpopulation as a 
causative agent of climate change. As a result, I find its discussions 
of <i>Adaptation</i> and <i>Mitigation</i> (see following paraqgraph) to be misleadingly optimistic.

like, and no computer program can include everything of importance with

 it takes no more brains <a class="fn">than those of a plant<span>
	 Scientific papers are at best approximations to truth. Rigorous peer 
review is often as much work as writing the paper in the first place, so
 one seldom does it. The first 3 CO<sub>2</sub> models I analyzed fully

persuaded me to develop my own model). Plants, however, are exposed to

<p>Ameliorating global heating will cost money. It will generate 
business opportunities for some, and reduce them for others. 
Consequently, much tobacco-style FUD is aimed at the interpretation of  
temperature proxies such as tree rings, marine sediments, ice cores, 
coral reefs, stalactites, &amp;c. In particular, there were indignant 
claims that the Medieval Warm Period (c. 950–1250) was just as hot as 
today (not true), so all is well (not true). The rationale seems to be 
this:
</p>

<blockquote>If we just ignore the data, global heating will go away. Let
 us declare paleothermometry to be junk science and the Weather Bureau 
(and 100 other research centers) incompetent. They are clearly doing 
what we learned to do in expensive MBA courses: spread Fear, 
Uncertainty, Doubt, and Lies to keep the research money rolling in.
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, each paleothermometer presents unique subtleties and is 
subject to confounding influences. This is why professionals devote 
their careers to testing and refining techniques and interpretations.
</p>

<p>Granted, the Weather Bureau cannot predict weather 2 weeks in 
advance, because the atmosphere is chaotic and weather happens at random
 in the right half of Fig. 1. This is why we focus on the smooth curve 
drawn through the left half of the figure.
</p>


<p>‘Figures don't lie, but liars do figure’. Here are some misleading things one could truthfully say about Fig. 1:</p>
<ul>
<li> The mean temperature was the same in 1926 and 1978.</li>
<li> 1944 was the hottest year of the [or ‘a’] century.</li>
<li> The record shows 60 years of mean temperature decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p class="flu"> — and none of them changes the 0.8°C rise.

<h3> </h3>

<p>It might seem strange that ‘belief’ in an established fact like 
climate change should separate political parties sharply. Yet 
psychologically it makes sense that Democrats should try to limit 
climate change, and that Republicans would obstruct them. (‘Latent 
ideology lies in <a class="fn">psychology.'<span>

	J Graham, J Haidt, BA Nosek (2009) ‘Liberals and Conservatives Rely on Different Sets of Moral Foundations’ <cite>J Personality and Social Psychology</cite> <b>96</b>(#5) 1024–1046; doi: 10.1037/a0015141.

 parameters that best distinguish conservatives from liberals. Of the 5 
foundations, Liberals score higher on Care and Fairness (ie, concern for
 others); Conservatives on Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Rs ask 
themselves, ‘Has climate change — if it isn't just weather variability —
 hurt me?’, and the answer is ‘No. The Ds just like to spend other 
peoples' money (instead of investing it)’, and ‘They're not getting 
mine!’ Ds looks at the world and see that climate change is already 
hurting people, that the damage will not be undoable in any human time 
frame, that is going get worse if we continue business as usual, and to 
minimize damage, want to limit what Rs are allowed to do to the world in
 pursuit of money.
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, because science progresses by falsifying bad ideas, 
those who practice it pay thoughtful attention to the arguments of 
contrarians in their field. And there are a number of useful contrarians
 who call attention to weaknesses in the debates about climate (in 
addition to any number of zealous deniers who contribute only noise). In
 the usual case, the latter have hold of a half-truth, of the sort 
treated below. Unfortunately, deniers often do not have the analytical 
skills for critical thinking. As a result, only the most patient of my 
friends still try to sort such people out. Unsorted, they populate the 
web with plausible but misleading blogs.
</p>

<p>Common examples of such confusion include:
</p>


<h4>1. Water vapor</h4>
<p>Water vapor has absorption bands all over the spectrum and so it is more important as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, with its single deep absorption in the middle of an H<sub>2</sub>O
 band. This is perfectly true — in the lower troposphere where radiation
 is trumped by turbulent mixing. Water vapor pretty much freezes out (at
 the snow line) well below the radiation level (which is above 5 km), 
and so makes a very minor contribution to global heating.
</p>

<h4>2. Saturation</h4>
<p>Noticing that all the available energy in the infrared CO<sub>2</sub> band is absorbed in about 10 m, a voluble subset of deniers has fastened on this fact as meaning — erroneously — that adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere cannot warm us further, because, obviously, all the IR is already being absorbed.
</p>

<p>But saturation is a function of the number of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per meter, and thus a function of pressure. Higher in the atmosphere there will be less CO<sub>2</sub>/
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                        m, and added CO<sub>2</sub> will absorb outgoing IR. The troposphere is well mixed, so that CO<sub>2</sub> added at at the bottom finds its way to the top quickly. As Fig. 13 shows, it is CO<sub>2</sub> at the top of the atmosphere that raises the radiation level and the ground temperature.
</p>

<h4>3. Satellite Measurements</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most frequent denial of global heating is based on the 
fact that satellite measurements ‘have shown that temperature has not 
risen in 17 years’. This is true but <i>irrelevant</i>: what satellites measure most easily and uncontroversially is the <i>radiation</i> temperature of the Earth, which is constant, rather than its <i>surface</i> temperature, which is changing. The radiation temperature is set as indicated in <a href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, the surface temperature in <a href="#F13">Fig. 13</a>.
</p>

<h4>4. Time Scales</h4>
<p>A typical denialist complaint is that a while back, climate 
scientists were predicting another ice age. Now they're predicting heat 
waves, so obviously they don't know what they are talking about. 
(Denialists are uncomfortable with change, but clearly on speaking terms
 with fraud, since it is the first thing they think of to explain the 
erratic progress of science.) If you look at the temperature-vs-time 
curves from the 4 km of ice at Vostok in Antarctica, you see <a href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>,
 with a sawtooth curve and a steep rise at the beginning of an 
interglacial, followed by a slow cooling into the next ice age. (There 
are now ice cores from 3 dozen sites, showing both general agreement and
 interesting local variation.) The sawtooth pattern was exciting news in
 1999 when it was <a class="fn">first published.<span>
	JR Petit &amp;18a (1999) ‘Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica’ <cite>Nature</cite> <b>99</b>: 429–436; doi:10.1038/20859
</span></a> Checking their algorithms against this new data, climate 
models suggested that by now, 12,000 years into the interglacial, 
eastern Canada would be accumulating ice again. Hence the concept of a 
new ice age <b>90,000 years down the road</b>.
</p>

<h4>5. ‘Alternative Facts’</h4>
<p>A typical <a class="fn">FUD paper<span>
	D'J Aleo, A Watts (2010) ‘Surface Temperature Records: Policy‐Driven&nbsp;Deception?’ <cite>SPPI Original Paper</cite> 2010-08-27 http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/originals/policy_driven_deception.html (2010-09-13),
</span></a> claims that instrumental records suffer from urban heat 
islands, land-use change, relocation of stations, missing data, poorly 
placed thermometers, and undocumented ‘adjustments’ that have left a 
record with a warming bias and no reliable way to correct it. The 
subphrase of its title, ‘Policy-based deception?’, again suggests
psychological projection of the authors' own <i>modus operandi</i>. The 
paper is part of a long carping suite of disinformation from the 
Heartland Institute, a raucous denier of climate change supported by and
 speaking for the <a class="fn">Koch coal billionaires<span>
	Who, be it noted, would not be billionaires if they paid miners a living wage.
</span></a>. In contrast to the FUD, careful analysis showed a slight <i>cooling</i>
 bias in US data, corresponding not to the suggested problems, but to 
the replacement of mercury thermometers by thermistors. This bias was 
removed by pairwise comparisons of trend lines spanning the period of 
replacement. The US Climate Reference Network (with some duplicate 
stations and triply redundant instrumentation) shows intercomparison 
uncertainties comparable to the precision of thermistors, in the <a class="fn">millikelvin<span>
	JM Zurbuchen (2000) ‘Precision Thermistor Thermometry’ (Measurement Specialties, Dayton OH).</span></a>
range (±0.001°C). ‘We find <a class="fn">no evidence<span>
	MJ Menne, CN Williams Jr, MA Palecki (2010) ‘On the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record’<cite> J Geophys Res</cite> <b>115</b> D11108, 9pp; doi:10.1029/2009JD013094.</span></a>
that the US average temperature trends are inflated due to poor station siting’.
</p>


<h4>6. You don’t stand by a cold stove to get warm</h4>
<p>This the argument of Dr Peter L. Ward, a retired USGS vulcanologist 
with an idiosyncratic grasp of physics. He is responding to Fig. 1.1 of <cite>IPCC Climate Change</cite>
 (2013: p 126) which shows a big downward arrow labelled ‘Back Longwave 
Radiation’. Recognizing that this shorthand cannot be the actual warming
 mechanism, misconstruing the Bohr-Einstein relation, and seeing a 
correlation between stratospheric ozone and the temperature record, Ward
 tells Republican Senators what they want to hear: ‘CO<sub>2</sub> is not the culprit. The ozone hole is letting in more UV, which has 48 times as much energy as CO<sub>2</sub>'s
 IR radiation.’ This is wrong; Bohr and Einstein added ‘per photon’ to 
that sentence, and there are very few UV photons and many IR photons. 
Despite numerous efforts, no one has been able to correct Ward, who 
points to Galileo as justification for contradicting the established 
physics of the last 100 years.

noisy as the temperature data. For clarity it has been replaced by 
discrete samples, mostly at local extrema.) The accumulation of ice 
begins as soon as insolation and the greenhouse between them are too 
weak to melt all of the winter's ice during the summer, approximately at
 the 0 line of temperature difference. The earlier ice ages suggested 
that we should be seeing year-old snow in eastern Canada by now, and 
some climate models agreed. This is not happening, so our interglacial

Early Methane. Ruddiman noticed that CO₂ began inceasing ~6,000 BCE, 
when we started clearing European forests for agriculture. Methane began
 increasing ~3000 BCE, when the Chinese started making rice paddies. 
(The dip labelled ‘YD’ is the Younger Dryas, a millennial cold dry 
period resulting from Laurentide icemelt inhibiting the Atlantic thermal
 circulation.) The coupling between low-latitude insolation and methane 
is probably through monsoon rains and lowland floods (stagnant water 
being a common source of methane). In short, Ruddiman suggests that we 
began changing the climate long before the Industrial Revolution.
</figcaption></figure>


<p>But Canada is <i>not</i> accumulating ice. In 2003, <a class="fn">Ruddiman<span>
	WF Ruddiman (2003) ‘The Anthropogenic Greenhouse Era Began Thousands of Years Ago’ <cite>Climatic Change</cite> <b>61</b>: 261–293.
</span></a> suggested that land clearance for Neolithic agriculture, 
beginning 8000 years ago, had injected enough anthropogenic greenhouse 
gases to make our interglacial different from the prototypes — a 
hypothesis he himself described as ‘provocative and controversial’, 
although I don't see why. Figure 3 shows the expected and actual changes
 in methane over the period in question, with methane being much more 
effective than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas. The graph for CO₂ shows a 
similar change of direction starting 8000 years ago.
</p>

<p>Nor does the conservative FUD change the reality of global heating. 
‘Climate sceptics’, apparently terrified of taxes, regulation, and loss 
of business, continue to exaggerate imaginary failings in the hope of 
discrediting scientists who study global heating. Accordingly, we look 
at a pair of indirect records whose data and interpretation — while 
still subtle — are independent, based on different techniques, and are 
perhaps more persuasive to the by-stander. These are the loss of Arctic 
sea ice and Antarctic land ice.

<p>This did not happen, and perversely, Antarctic <i>sea</i> ice is <i>increasing</i>.
 Poorly informed sceptics misinterpret this to deny global heating and 
display the incompetence of scientists, but the projection was from 
models that did not include circumpolar fluid thermodynamics with <a class="fn">sufficient subtlety<span>
	Just as a truly accurate map would be the same size as the terrain it 
represents, a truly accurate model would run as slowly as the real 
world. Each model now has thousands of hours of development time behind 
it, endeavoring to incorporate what its creators believe are the most 
important processes in realistic (and efficient) algorithms. The best 
way to appreciate the problems is to get involved. Laptops now have the 
capacity to run the super-computer models of the 1970s, so you could run
 your own first-order model. Even better, the Climateprediction.net runs
 a distributed computing project to which anyone with a home computer 
can contribute. They have run over 80,000,000 model years on 50,000 
contributing personal computers, with an increasingly sophisticated 
series of global climate models.

</span></a>. Warmer water north of the Antarctic Convergence evaporates.
 Naïvely expected to increase precipitation on the land mass, it instead
 snows out before it reaches the coast, creating a fresh-water input 
that reduces the salinity and density of surface seawater, while raising
 its freezing point and increasing its vertical stability. This produces
 a cold, thin, quickly frozen surface layer. The present balance (not 
necessarily permanent) results in more sea ice. (After all, ‘warming’ in
 Antarctica can mean going from -20°C to -12°C, and ice still forms.)
</p>

<p>The major concern in Antarctica is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Ice 
sheets are what glaciers turn into when they hit the ocean, and their 
size is a balance between glacial input and ice-edge calving of icebergs
 and melting. The Larsen A Ice Shelf (at the warm end of West 
Antarctica) collapsed in  1995, the adjacent Larsen B, about the size of
 Rhode Island, having been stable for 12,000 years, disintegrated in 3 
summer weeks of 2002. The Ross Ice Shelf, about the size of France, 
showed signs of instability by May 2014. Its disintegration would not 
raise sea level (because it is floating ice), but it would unblock the 
glaciers that feed it, which have the mass to raise sea level by 3 
meters in, say, <a class="fn">a century<span>
	This, incidentally, is why I built my house at 250 m above sea level, 
instead of down by the beach at the end of my river, with its warm 
water, interesting marine life, and topless girls. Glacial surges have 
been known to outrun people, and there is a high-water mark in the 
Thames Valley which appears to be the result of an Antarctic ice surge.

 to deny global heating comes from the biological world. By 2002, <a class="fn">Gian-Reto Walther<span>

responds to day length (migration) and another to temperature (insect 
food for nestlings) are confused: evolution will be rapid here. Heat- 
and drought-resistant alleles have spread into populations that never 
needed them.
</p>

<p>One of the more striking examples is the circumpolar Arctic walrus. 
Normally, walruses use ice floes to rest, sleep, raise their young, and 
scan the bottom for molluscs. By October of 2014 there was <a class="fn">so little<span>

</p>

<p>Put bluntly, <b>those who know what is going on have been adjusting for decades.</b>
 (Oddly, this includes trees and bugs — but not bankers, CEOs, or 
politicians.) The world of nature is exquisitely aware of what is 
happening ‘out there’, posessing a perspective known only to humans who 
are similarly in touch with the real world — bird-watchers, backpackers,
 gardeners, ecologists, field biologists, climatologists, and their ilk.
 The challenge of climate change has driven human evolution in the past.
 At the 10<sup>5</sup>-year scale, it forced cranial growth of <i>Saharapithecus tchadensis</i> and relatives. At the 10<sup>3</sup>-year scale, it drove us to new techniques for dealing with the ice-age and its retreat. At the 10<sup>1</sup>-year
 scale, might it thin out the ranks of the unadaptive
climate-change deniers — people who subsist in heated/air-conditioned 
space, so insulated from the natural world that we might call them 
‘denatured’? In the absence of technology (and the financial ability to 
protect themselves artificially), they would be the first to succumb to 
natural change. Biologically speaking, they are dead fossils walking.

 — independent of the IPCC — initially concluded that the cost of 
‘reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate
 change’ would be 1% of the GWP. However, this 1% comes 
disproportionately out of the income of the ‘elite’, while the initial 
costs of global heating fall upon what are commonly called ‘useless 
eaters’. Some of the ‘elite’ see this as a benefit (possibly reducing 
the numbers of the eaters — while overlooking the irreversible, global 
nature of the process), so nothing has happened. (The later costs, when 
mitigation will have little effect, will fall on developed countries and
 cities.)

<p class="epi">I am never content until I have constructed a … model of 
the subject I am studying. If I succeed in making one, I understand; 
otherwise I do not.  — Lord Kelvin (1904), who said ‘mechanical’ at the 
ellipsis, but most models today are computational.
</p>

<p>The <i>fact</i> of global heating may be well established, but the <i>cause</i>
 is not quite so certain. The details above are based on 20 years of 
work by some 800 researchers and 2500 reviewers. Received wisdom has 
been that climate is the product of many influences. As is evident from 
Fox ‘News’, a major, if illogical, complaint of the ‘climate deniers’ is
 that all of the predictions of future change are based on computer 
models instead of data. Ignoring the difficulty of obtaining future data
 in time to make use of them, the important feature is that <b>until one can model climate, one cannot pretend to understand it</b>. Our current grasp of short-term effects is shown by the detailed agreement of the two lines in the upper graph of Fig. 9.
</p>

<p>The frequent statement by climate deniers, that they ‘haven't ƒ’, may
 mean that they  don't want to look, that they lack the analytic ability
 to read Fig. 9, or that they do not understand that ‘Anthropogenic 
effects’ is synonymous with ‘fossil-fuel CO₂’. All natural processes 
that affect the Earth's surface temperature are cyclic (solar output) or
 episodic with a return to normal (vulcanism, El Niño), or random around
 a zero mean (the spikes).

Start with a warm interglacial climate like today's, but without 
anthropogenic CO₂ input. Phytoplankton slowly but steadily draw down 
atmospheric CO₂, die, increase organic carbon in sediments, and thence 
methane clathrates. The gradual loss of atmospheric CO₂ cools the 
climate, with (as the models show) major effect in the arctic zones. 
Milankovitch willing, land ice accumulates, sea level drops, but exposed
 Arctic-basin sediments are cold enough to preserve the methane ice. The
 process continues until there’s a mile-thick glacier in the northern 
hemisphere, and sea-level fall has exposed several hundred vertical 
meters of clathrate-rich sediments on continental shelves and slopes. 
This situation is thermodynamically metastable; all it needs now is a 
Milankovitch insolation peak to produce a warm Arctic summer, and it 
releases a 50,000-year accumulation of a greenhouse gas with <a class="fn">many times<span>
	The Global Warming Potential of a greenhouse gas is a complicated 
function of its atmospheric lifetime, spectral absorption, and time

low end, as in Iceland — constantly replenished by slow downhill

of this process is extreme erosion of the upland valleys, devastating 
floods and silting during the summer monsoon, winter drought throughout 
India, Southeast Asia, and China, and 2 billion desperate and angry

<p>Modelling this hypothesis requires more computational power than I 
have available, so I content myself with describing it. It accounts 
nicely for the rise of temperature before CO₂, for the sawtooth nature 
of the isotopic temperature record, and it offers a plausible driver for
 the 100-kyr glaciation cycle. The fact that methane is currently 
escaping from Arctic sediments might seem contradictory: Why did it not 
all boil off 12,000 years ago at the start of the interglacial? All I 
can suggest is that additional warming from the 100 ppm of anthropogenic
 CO₂ is reaching deeper into the permafrost, again making this 
interglacial different from all others.

 which (from the data in Table 2) is 1 trillion barrels (1 Gbbl), almost
 exactly what we burned in the 20th century, and it raised the mean 
temperature 0.8°C. Now double each dimension, and the volume is 8

it 6.4°C — and world agriculture is in terminal disarray.

<p>The 2 billion people alive in 1900 were the sustainable population of
 the day, living off of solar energy in its many natural forms (wind, 
wood, water, whale oil, and a bit of coal) — except that they nearly 
drove the whales extinct. Given improvements in agriculture and 
extension of cropland, the sun may now support 3 billion people, but oil
 supports the rest. Much of the current unrest in the world arises from 
our inability to keep up with their expectation of an ever-increasing 
standard of living — showing that the simple linear extrapolation is 
already too optimistic.
</p>

<p>The 2°C temperature increase once assumed to be acceptable is proving to be <a href="https://medium.com/@350/temperature-check-1f076624c55b#.6ptogqjcn">too much</a>, and the consensus is that <a href="http://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/2c.html">1.5°C</a>
 will stress our civilization as much as it can bear. Today's wars and 
mass migrations may be exacerbated by US bombings, but they are a 
harbinger of more to come as temperature increase and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/middle-east-faces-water-shortages-for-the-next-25-years-study-says">water shortages</a> spread in desert areas.
</p>

<p>There is still discourse in which ‘growth’ and ‘sustainability’ occur
 together, often with the premise that the first is necessary for the 
second. For a century, economic growth has meant increased oil usage. 
Table 2 tells us that we can no longer do this.  There is another 
trillion barrels of conventional oil in the ground: using this will 
raise the temperature to the acceptable limit. Using all known 
(pre-fracking) fossil reserves (coal, tar sands, heavy oil) will raise 
the temperature by 4.4°C (based on the linear extrapolation, not on 
computer simulation). Fracking will take it even higher. <i>We do not want to do this.</i>
 We want to keep the Koch Brothers and Exxon-Mobil and Big Oil from 
doing it to us. Corporations, deliberately ignoring science, see only 
agitators trying to keep them from making money. Not being a CEO, I find
 this suicidally irrational. If it were just suicide, this would be 
splendidly self-correcting; the problem is Tom Lehrer's: ‘we all will go

<p>Figure 13 is a toy thermodynamic model in which the earth is a 
blackbody. The model is rigorous, simple, and follow directly from Fig. 
1. It depends on the First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy is conserved), 
the Perfect Gas Law (PV=<i>R</i>T), and the standard well mixed, 
constant-composition, troposphere. It starts from a steady state in 
which all the energy that the earth receives from the sun is reradiated 
to space at the same rate (otherwise the earth warms or cools). These 
are all valid assumptions, and they are where the ~40 supercomputer 
models also started. It needs 3 numbers only, 2 of which are fairly easy
 to measure these days — the energy density of sunlight at the top of 
the atmosphere, and the earth's albedo, the fraction of sunlight 
reflected immediately. The remaining number, τ = infrared optical depth,
 or equivalently, the 255°K radiation level, lies within the tropophere,
 and varies with latitude, being closer to the ground nearer to the 
poles. It is measured by 1,600 weather balloons daily.
</p>

<p>To avoid having to deal with the lack of a top to the atmosphere, we 
ignore gravity and compress the entire atmosphere to its scale depth of 
11 km, at which size it is all at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. This 
compression makes very little difference to anything in the model, and 
it lets us give a precise meaning to the optical depth τ, which is the 
lowest altitude from which infrared photons can escape (statistically) 
without interacting with any more <a class="fn">gas molecules<span>
	 Like everything else in the climate system (such as the radius of the 
Earth or its distance from the sun), this is a mean value allowing one 
to make understandable first-order models. For the messy details, see 
the IPCC reports.
</span></a>. Having found the optical depth (or, more practically, the 
pressure at the radiation level) we unscale the atmosphere and let 
gravity restore the pressure gradient.

The Changing Surface Temperature: The infrared optical depth τ (which 
shortens as greenhouse gasses increase) determines the altitude at which
 255°K photons last interact with molecules and can escape to space. All
 the red lines are attached to the red dot, and move up as τ shortens. 
(Note that water mostly freezes out at the snow line, and does not have 
much effect on τ.) The intersection of the lapse rate line with the 
ground then determines the mean surface temperature. (Using the 
scale-height atmosphere lets us put a conceptual top on the atmosphere, 
and so define a radiation level. [It also confounds the modelled lapse 
rate, which in fact is curved and depends upon the pressure change with 
height in the real atmosphere.] <i>All</i> models simplify: their utility comes from knowing which simplifications are permissible in aid of <a class="fn"> practicality<span>

<p>We now need the concept of ‘potential temperature’. Think of air as 
existing in ‘parcels’ about the size of weather balloons, surrounded by 
infinitely elastic membranes which prohibit mixing or energy exchange. 
Motion is then adiabatic (no heat enters or leaves the parcel). The 
parcel changes pressure, volume, and temperature in accordance with the 
perfect-gas law as it rises or descends, but it is always at the same 
temperature at the same altitude. For climatologists, it makes sense to 
define the potential temperature at the optical-depth/radiation-level: 
its actual temperature after being compressed to 1 atmosphere (1013 hPa)
 is then the surface temperature of the earth. Notice once again: no 
heat is required to raise its temperature during this process, and below
 the radiation level, back-radiation from greenhouse gasses can be 
included as part of the turbulent mixing that maintains a constant 
composition <a class="fn">troposphere<span>
	PV work is done on a parcel as it descends and is compressed and 
warmed; it does equal work on the surroundings if it rises, expands, and
 cools. The rate at which the temperature increases below the radiation 
level is the lapse rate, and ranges from 5.5°C/km for wet air to 10°C/km
 for dry air, with the meteorologists' standard value 6.5°C/km.<br>

	Energy is conserved in these processes; entropy, which measures the 
usability of that energy, is produced. Entropy is always confusing 
because we have no sensor that notices it, and no word for its unit, 
which is joule/°K,* although the name ‘clausius’ has been used 
informally. The most accessible definition is dS=dQ/T, where dS is the 
change in entropy, dQ the change in heat, and T the temperature. The 
Earth exports 5800°/255° = 22.7 times as much entropy as it absorbs from
 the sun, and it is this entropy production that drives weather and 
ocean currents and supports life.
<br>------------------<br>
	* The powers that be have declared that the degree and its sign are not
 needed when talking about kelvins. I retain the ° symbol because 
unadorned K is a chemical-equilibrium constant in my world, appearing in
 many of the equations that I write, and I am easily confused.

<p>A relatively simple zonal (2-dimensional pole-to-pole) <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI3373.1">radiation-balance model</a>
 gives excellent agreement with surface-temperature data sets (its Fig. 
5). It also shows that a working estimate for the radiation level is the
 650 hPa isobar (its Fig. 6), which is ~3,700 m or 12,000 feet.
</p>

<p>In short, solar input implies that the mean radiation temperature of 
the earth is 255°K, and an air temperature of 255°K at 12,000 feet 
implies a surface temperature of 14°C. Add CO₂ and 255°K moves higher 
and the 14°C increases.

<p class="epi">This presentation is the ‘30-page’ version. For the ‘600-page’ version, see <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/about/">ScienceofDoom</a>,
 a level-headed and thorough collection of tutorial discussions of all 
aspects of climate science, which responds to rude skeptics with serious
 attempts explain the view of climate scientists on the issue in 
question.
</p>

<p>If the simple thermodynamic model is rigorous, why is so much effort 
put into IPCC? The easy answer is that the thermo model is a concise 
description of what the IPCC has discovered. Obtaining the 288°K annual 
mean surface temperature from the observed daily 100°C range of ground 
temperatures required a long and painstaking international effort.
</p>

<p>The supercomputer models become trustworthy only when they <a class="fn">reproduce historical climate<span>
	Oddly, deniers seem to regard this essential (backcasting) step as 
cheating, and forecasting as ‘just computer modelling’. None of them 
offer an approach beyond ‘Climate is always changing. Live with it. And 
don't use our taxes for preparation!’. (They will, one suspects, be 
equally vocal about requesting socialist help when climate-related 
emergencies arise.)
</span></a> from historical data. The attempt to predict future values 
of the optical depth τ draws in economic historians, futurologists, 
demographers, anthropologists, and sociologists. The verbal input of 
these experts must be converted to numerical parameters before the 
computers can use them: this is one of the subtlest of skills, fraught 
with uncertainties. Political sensitivities preclude public discussion 
of realistic possibilities, such as the consequences of a 
climate-induced population crash, or the probabilty that preparations 
for martial law and militarization of police forces are in expectation 
of serious disorder when global heating, energy shortages, and crop 
failures arrive simultaneously.
</p>

<p>By far the easiest use of increased computer power is to reduce the 
size of the geographical step, and over the years this has gone from 
500-km steps in 1970 to 110-km steps in 2007, and from 1 fluid layer 
(atmosphere or ocean) to  <a class="fn">30 in each<span>
	IPCC (2007): Summary for Policymakers. In: <cite>Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. 4th Assessment Report</cite> (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK): 113.
</span></a>. (Sometimes this reduction produces unexpected results, for 
reasons that are not completely understood.) New processes have been 
added, in the sequence: CO₂ and rain in 1970s, then clouds and ice, a 
shallow ‘swamp’ ocean, volcanoes, sulphates, a deep ocean, the carbon 
cycle, rivers, aerosols, an overturning ocean, interactive vegetation, 
and UV-induced atmospheric chemistry.
</p>

<p>The bottom line, in terms of ‘radiative forcing’ (which is measured in W/m<sup>2</sup>, like the incoming energy, is shown in Table 3. CO₂ contributes 1.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Everything else sums to almost zero:
</p>

<p>Note the small effect of water vapor. Although often cited as ‘the 
most important greenhouse gas’ this is true only below the radiation 
level. Below cloud level, it blocks most IR radiation, and transports 
the latent heat of condensation up to the clouds. But most water freezes
 out by 5 km, and what is found in the stratosphere is newly formed from
 oxidized methane. Much of the effect of ‘other GHG’ is from 
meat-production methane, generated in the rumens of cattle during the 
bacterial digestion of cellulose. Although the carbon in this methane 
was removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis of cattle fodder, 
methane, with 4 C-H bonds to absorb energy, is a much more powerful GHG 
than CO₂. With a 12.5-year half-life, it make an appreciable 
contribution to global warming.</p>

<p>Science fiction might come to the rescue at this point, with something like a realization of ‘<a class="fn">Chicken Little<span>
	F Pohl, CM Kornbluth (1952) <cite>Space Merchants</cite> (St. Martin's Press, NYC).
</span></a>’, a fast-growing (cancerous?) tissue culture fed  alga-derived glucose, producing chicken meat <a class="fn">quickly<span>
	In 1912, Dr Alexis Carrel bathed an embryonic  chicken-heart culture in
 nutrient broth. It doubled in size every 48 hours and lived for at 
least 34 years. No-one has replicated this work, and most tissue 
cultures have limited lifetimes. The influence of stem cells and 
telomere length on culture longevity are open questions.
</span></a>, with no methane production.
</p>

<p>One final question is ‘Where does the additional energy to warm the earth come from if everything is in balance?’. I <i>told</i> you that we lied to you: it isn’t quite in balance. NASA's <a class="fn">
	Jim Hansen <span>&amp;3a (2011) ‘Earth's energy imbalance and implications’ <cite>Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</cite> <b>11</b>: 13421-13449.

 more than it radiated over the 2005–2010 period, with 71% of the energy
 going into the ocean (in proportion to its fractional area), confirming
 ‘the dominant role of the human-made greenhouse effect in driving 
global climate change’. This value is <a class="fn">less than 1/4<span>

</p>

<p>A <a class="fn">discouraging aspect<span>

 Change course (recommended for those of mathematical bent).
</span></a> is the effective <a class="fn">permanence<span>

</span></a> of adding CO₂ to the atmosphere. If you look only at 
geochemistry (with a geological timescale), you see atmospheric CO₂ in 
equilibrium with dissolved CO₂, and the latter reacting with carbonate 
sediments to form harmless <a class="fn">bicarbonate ions<span>
	Disproportionation: CO₂ + H₂O + CO₃<sup>2-</sup> ⇄  2HCO₃<sup>1-</sup>.
</span></a>, so there is a steady drawdown of atmospheric CO₂ leading to
 a return to today's equilibrium. But most of the ocean does not come in
 contact with enough solid carbonates to matter <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2009/01/26/203610/noaa-climate-change-irreversible-1000-years-drought-dust-bowls/"><i>on a human timescale</i></a>.
 There are no carbonates on the deep sea floor (because sinking 
foraminifera tests dissolve by a pressure effect before reaching the 
bottom), and it takes 10,000 years for water to make the thermohaline 
circuit (sinking under polar ice shelves to form bottom water, flowing 
slowly around the globe, rising imperceptibly to the surface — most 
distantly in the North Pacific — and flowing by surface currents back to
 the poles. It can make many circuits without contacting shallow-water 
carbonates on continental slopes. What we have already done to the 
atmosphere and climate may outlive our tenure on the planet.

<p>Climate change may be our first priority among threats, but it is not
 alone. Outranking all the popular political and military alarms, the 
collection in Table 4 includes the phenomena most likely to become 
culture breakers.
</p>

<p>In closing, we again come to frontier science, this time in the 
attempt to recognize planetary boundaries, and — drawing upon 
multidisciplinary  understanding — to quantify them. Like climate change
 (which presents one of the boundaries) this requires immense 
collaborative effort. Boundaries are not obvious, their effects are 
insidious, their consequences diffuse, and their causes impersonal. To 
individuals, they are not recognizable as either threats or things that 
can be changed. Avoiding these boundaries often requires governmental 
regulation, to prevent people from doing as they please when the 
cumulative consequences are culture breaking. The conservative wing of 
the Senate apparently exists to oppose such regulations. If crossing a 
boundary is 90-day profitable, it is acceptable — whatever its long-term
 consequences.

<p>The eleven planetary boundaries of Table 3 have so far been 
recognized. The idea of a boundary is that potential catastrophes lie 
ahead. In some cases their approach seems slow but inexorable; in 
others, possibly sudden and disastrous. Given Lao Tzu's startling 
observation that ‘If we do not change direction, we may end up where we 
are heading’, it seems smart to put a notional fence between us and the 
disasters. Since we know what worked during the Holocene (11,700 
BCE–1760), a good bet is that we might be able to extend the 
Anthropocene (1760–??) indefinitely by maintaining conditions similar to
 those of the Holocene. Table 3 presents some boundaries we should not 
cross if we hope to do this. Note that every boundary is at least as 
complex as the discussion of global heating <a href="#04">above</a>. Rockström did not mention the final entry.

principal driver of the entries above — has not been mentioned, nor have
 social limits, such as wealth distribution. Web searches for papers by
