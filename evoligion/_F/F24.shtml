<p class="epi">There is a planet-wide hunger for myths: images and dreams that reflect our radically altered sense of who, where and when we are&hellip;and where we might go and who we might become. &mdash; Carl Sagan
</p>

<p class="epi">[A]ll the institutions that make democracy possible have been hollowed out and rendered impotent and ineffectual. &mdash; Chris Hedges
</p>

<p>In common usage, <i>mythical</i> describes &lsquo;a widely held traditional but false belief&rsquo;, a characteristic usage by proselytizers intent on replacing existing myths with their own. Carl Sagan&apos;s deeper <i>mythic</i> hunger may be experienced as anything from malaise to jihad.
</p>

<p>The most popular myth of the US in recent years seems to be some version of &lsquo;Bonnie and Clyde as yuppies&rsquo;, with acceptance of and pride in individual theft of identity, corporate theft of wages, Wall Street theft of homes and pensions, and Washington theft of Constitutional protections. This may be only narcissism of the Me generation showing up in the workplace, but it is not what we are looking for.
</p>

<p>A hypothesis holds that the harsh Depression led to the gentle New Deal, while the gormless consumer culture led to voodoo Reaganomics, sociopathic CEOs and bankers, Obstructionist politicians, and their cooperative <a class="fn">obliteration of the middle class.<span>
	Bear in mind that as a scientist I was living in the lab and in my imagination throughout the 60s&ndash;90s and oblivious to popular culture, so my interpretation is derivative, influenced by the retrospective writing of others.
</span></a> If this be true, its time to reboot. It would be useful to drop American myths based on misinterpretation of the Second Amendment, and look instead at those encapsulated by the hard problems of the Preamble: <span class="br">&lsquo;establish Justice&rsquo;</span> and <span class="br">&lsquo;promote the general Welfare&rsquo;</span>.

<p>These ideas may seem truly mythical today, because we have too long permitted the 1&permil; to live by their family mottos: <a class="fn"><i>Multo furtum, non carcerem</i><span>
	&lsquo;Much theft, no jail&rsquo;.
</span></a> and <a class="fn"><i>Quoque magnus deficere.</i><span>
	&lsquo;Too big to fail&rsquo;.
</span></a> and they administer the Justice. Earlier, we had  minimized this nonsense for 40 years &mdash; although there are conflicting stories about how we accomplished this. Ranked by increasing probabiity, these are:


<ol>
<li>Things had gotten so bad that honest people ran for office;</li>

<li>Roosevelt betrayed his class in exchange for 4 terms as President;</li>

<li>The 1&permil; allowed us temporary concessions (unions, Social Security) only as long as the USSR appeared to be a working <a class="f">socialist model.<span>
	The USSR was beligerent after WW2, which made it easy to demonize the Communist government, and thence Socialism. Demonizing the working Socialism of the gentle Scandinavian countries was simply not a feasible public relations project, so we pretended they did not exist and had nothing to teach us.
</spam></a></li>
</ol>


<p class="flu">All 3 stories seem have contributed something to the result, with the Supreme Court being slow to catch up with public opinion. Still, it should not be impossible to reassert Constitutional justice and restart the system from its high point in 1960.

<p class="epi">[T]he penalty of failure to love and create is the irresistible need to hate and destroy. &mdash; Gordon Rattray Taylor
</p>

<p>The first row of the heading table describes the challenge facing Ecclesia, if it aspires to relevance. The better groups &mdash; Humanist, deist, Unitarian/Universalist, Zoroastrian, Buddhists and others &mdash; share the goals of the Enlightenment, so this is a known requirement. Sects with a millennium-old inerrant dogma have, during that millennium, demonstrated the society that it generates: Paul gave us the Dark Ages of Europe; Mohamet, the Arab Conquest and its current chaos. Neither has produced an egalitarian society that maximizes <a class="fn">individual opportunity,<span>
	Asoka&apos;s Buddhist India seems to have been the closest approach, but it was forcibly dismantled by competing religions.
    </span></a> showing that the dogmas need rethinking &mdash; but adherents can always find historical excuses. <a href="F22.shtml#18">Mondrag&oacute;n ??? </a> with no overt religious concerns, is the best current candidate, which might suggest something important to our churches.
</p>

<p>Unable to demonstrate secular success, the fallback position of an unsatisfactory religion is to focus on instructions for reaching an improved afterlife. This is useful only insofar as it generates a positive real-world result, ideally a tripartite response:
</p>


<ul class="u1">
<li><b>Gaian</b>, including a passionate reverence for all life, and active defense of diversity and plenitude;
<li><b>Eirenic</b>, working for freedom from want and fear, with a more equitable distribution of wealth; and a
<li><b>Personal</b> on-going pursuit of wisdom (or at least education and altruism).
</ul>

<p class="flu">Without these responses, the focus on an afterlife is useless Instinct-1 egocentrism. If you can&apos;t leave the world a better place than you found it, why should you expect anything better in your own future?
</p>

<p>A congregation (as opposed to the church it belongs to) has primary responsibilities to its members. The church itself should be asking Dawkins&apos;s question about churches finding a way to be relevant in the future: What can we uniquely do to help repair a failing civilization? There is no dearth of opportunity: Only the vision is lacking.

<p class="epi">The future of the West is not a limitless tending upwards and onwards for all time towards our present ideals, but a single phenomenon of history, strictly limited and defined as to form and duration, which covers a few centuries and can be viewed and, in essentials, calculated from available precedents. &mdash; <a class="fn">Spengler<span>

<p>The intellectuals of any church that has found a way to employ them (such as the Jesuits of the Roman church) will be accustomed to thinking in mythic terms, and thus able appreciate the importance of myth. Society generally accepts its own defining myths as simple fact: George Washington <i>did too</i> chop down the cherry tree. The Gospels (despite their internal disagreement on facts and unanimous contradiction of known Jewish and Roman practice) <i>are too</i> accurate historical documents. Meanwhile, the 2 dozen myths discussed <a href="#T24.1">below</a> silently guide society without attracting attention.

<p class="epi">[C]hildren&apos;s ways of thinking about the world never go away [&hellip;, so] a lot of adult supernatural beliefs &hellip; have their origins in the way that children misconceive the world. &mdash; B. M. Hood, author of <cite>SuperSense</cite>
</p>

<p>Akhnaton, prematurely conscious in a smoothly working bicameral world, saw  superstitious overbelief in the totemistic zo√∂morphs of the Egyptian pantheon. These, which had already worked for 4000 years, he tried to replace with a benevolent Deist sun &mdash; an idea that would be useful today. He failed: the bicameral mind could not be swayed in a single generation. The priestly reaction may well have intensified overbeliefs at the expense of more useful mythic content. But the myths were not necessarily bad, as Fig. 24.1 makes clear. Egyptian views of the afterlife were far more rational and <a class="fn">conducive to civilized behavior<span>
	Mohamatism acknowledges this by its virulent hatred of Classical Egypt, and its persistent desire to destroy its heritage.
</span></a> 3200 years ago than they are today. By all accounts its people were happier. Despite Hollywood epics, the people who built the pyramids were not slaves. They were doing the work of the gods, with all the fervor of today&apos;s Bible Belt believers tackling a church project.

<p>An unexpected theme that emerges from previous chapters is that most of the damage done by religion is indirect, through primary education. Much of what we teach is myth, and our myths circumscribe our vision. We have touched on Hindu, Moslem, Industrial Revolution, Southern Baptist, and general US primary education, and in each case, it seems that the growing brain is permanently affected by the manner and content of teaching. Although this book has paid little attention to <a class="fn">Catholicism,<span>
	This book has paid little attention to any form of Christianity, despite its importance in the world. There are over 300 books a year published on Christianity, several of them worth reading.
</span></a> Jesuits have always claimed that a child taught by them until age 7 would inevitably <a class="fn">return to the church,<span>
	Despite a murky past, the Jesuits these days are &mdash; as such things go &mdash; acceptable missionaries. Exemplified by French priest Fran√ßois Ponchaud, Jesuits in South East Asia have found that actions speak louder than words, and (unlike the proselytizing Baptists and Mormons) do not tie humanitarian aid to conversion, do not baptize &lsquo;rice Christians&rsquo;, and &lsquo;work with the ancient [Buddhist] social-spiritual structures, not against them&rsquo;. (This does not change the fact that as myths go, the Buddhist stories are far more useful than those of the Jesuits.)

</p>

<p>At the personal level, childhood acceptance of the mythic substructure of society determines expectations and the interpretation of events. At the social level, it makes governance easier and increases social cohesion &mdash; but it is governance for the governors and too often a cohesion of vicious ignorance and viscous conservatism that goes far to explain the continuation of unacceptable <a class="fn">aspects of society.<span>
	Consider the week&apos;s news as I edit this chapter. Bernstein and Woodward look back at Nixon in &lsquo;A no good lying bastard still&rsquo;, whose crimes were &lsquo;far worse than [we] knew&rsquo;. Nixon displayed &lsquo;a willingness to disregard the law for political advantage, and a quest for dirt and secrets about his opponents as an organizing principle of his presidency&rsquo;.
<br><br>
	Too young to vote at the time, I knew about the &lsquo;dirt and secrets&rsquo; &mdash; and lies &mdash; from his 1950 Senate campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas. If a California teenager could see through his red-baiting, Tricky Dick&apos;s character and future behavior could hardly have been unanticipated by his political sponsors!
<br><br>
	The only plausible explanation for blindness is acceptance of the Myth of the Red Menace. Anything that threatened alpha-male money and power (e.g., women in Congress, affordable housing, labor unions, equal rights for niggers, progressive income tax, and everything else that Douglas stood for) was a Communist plot to destroy America.

<p class="epi">Descensus Averno facilis est. &mdash; Virgil
</p>

<p>Individual myths survive the ravages of time rather well if they are couched as interesting parables. The real problem is that the <i>tenor</i> of myth decays with time. To wit, starting with the Axial Age, the sequence that we know best went:
</p>


<ul class="u1">
<li><b>Zoroaster</b> described the individual behavior needed to optimize society, with little overbelief (in the original). See the final <a href="F25.shtml#Zoro">end paper</a>.</li>

<li><b>Gautama</b> taught right behavior leading to a future free of suffering by dissolution of individuality; again, initially free of overbelief.</li>

<li><b>Plato</b> thought philosopher-kings could guide us to a civilized society without help from the Olympians.</li>

<li><b> Jesus</b> hoped for a miracle that would dispose of the Romans and establish an earthly kingdom of brotherly love, under a concerned but Deist YHVH.</li>

<li><b>Paul</b> made the kingdom postmortem, with salvationist overbelief the essential prerequisite.</li>

<li><b>Muhamad</b> made overbelief the key to his brotherhood of warriors fighting their way to endless postmortem virtual sex.</li>

<li><b>Joseph Smith</b> offered premortem real sex with multiple wives.</li>
</ul>


<p>The trend is decadent, removing personal responsibility bit by bit, with the quality of the dream declining and the salesmen asking less of people and promising more &mdash; perhaps finely tuned to its audience. The Axial Age decayed to the Dark Ages in Europe, to the Arab Conquest in the desert lands, and to a millennium in which our myths lost their grip, reduced to Sunday School stories. Something similar must have happened during the Neolithic also, before writing left records. It&apos;s happening currently, but no cultural historian seems to be keeping tabs on the process today.
</p>

<p>Revitalized by the Enlightenment, Paine, Madison, and Jefferson wrote the political version of Zoroaster, making a bold claim that the dream was in fact attainable in the here-and-now. Eleven score and some years later, we are again testing whether a nation so conceived can long endure. We responded to the Civil War and its threat of Balkanization; we seem oblivious to the 2nd round, with the same enemy &mdash; internal, flag-waving, lobbyists on K-Street &mdash; working indefatigably behind a misrepresented threat of terrorism. Our lack of response to a generation of relentless corrosion of the Constitution leaves the end result in serious doubt. At the very least, we need to review and revive our guiding myths.

</h3>

<p>Psychologists among the shamans first realized the power of myth, and then found ways to control people by massaging the myths. Academic psychologists refined our understanding of the process; public-relations professionals systematized the techniques; advertizing agencies turned them commercial; spin-doctors turned them political; actor-politicians applied them &mdash; and the victims swallowed them whole. You can perhaps imagine the uproar if some enterprising school started teaching children to resist this relentless manipulation!
</p>

<p>On the other hand, these same well developed tools could be used to propagate useful myths. Many contemporary myths are simply detrimental. Some are neutral &mdash; and a select few are valuable. The point is that individually, by introspection and analysis, we can chose the myths we believe, and teach our children. Whether we can do this collectively in an ethical manner is more problematic, but the issue is survival. Examples appear below.

<p>The epigraph offers the extreme case of a myth that nearly everyone recognizes as false: &lsquo;Moonlight damages plants&rsquo;. It is, however, instructive, telling us several things about mythical belief. These include:
</p>


<ul class="u1">
<li>Myths can persist indefinitely in the face of what the majority regards as obvious conflict with facts. The Flat Earth Society claims continuity with Genesis, but the idea of a flat earth is common sense that goes back to the Paleolithic. (The circular shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse shows only that it is circular, not that it is spherical. Recognition of a spherical earth requires watching ships go hull down, or a nodding acquaintance with <a class="fn">astronomical history<span>

</span></a> or geodesy.)

<li>Some brains lose ability to learn (ie, form new synapses) before puberty. To accept the epigraph, one has to be ignorant of basic facts that many people learn before starting school.

<li>Just as lack of an immune system exposes one to multiple diseases, lack of critical analysis exposes one to multiple mistaken myths.
</ul>


<p class="flu">Our short list of myths is &mdash; among other things &mdash; an argument for better education of girls, because mothers provide the earliest answers. The sort of confusion it indicates could also be reduced by introducing informal science in kindergarten, when curiosity is highest and answers are accepted most easily. &lsquo;Informal science&rsquo; merely means teachers who are alert to opportunities to encourage curiosity and rational thinking, whenever a child asks an <a class="fn"
>intelligent question.<span>
	I have been asked intelligent questions by a 3-year old whose articulation of the language required me to call in a 5-year-old sister to interpret. One such question was why butterflies visited flowers, and it led to a dissection of a flower to find (and taste) its nectary, thence to discussions of the Malagasy orchid with a 12-inch-deep nectary, and Darwin&apos;s prediction of a butterfly with a 12-inch tongue (when it was discovered, years later, it turned out to be a moth &mdash; a clear instance of a Darwinian error! There may be an infra-red video on YouTube: look for &lsquo;Darwin&apos;s Moth&rsquo;.), and thence to an introduction to co-evolution &mdash; all of it fascinating to a 3-year old. Unless you deal with such questions when they arise, you miss the optimum moment for education, and effectively cheat the child into waiting years for the educational system to get around to covering the topic.

<a href="#TOC"   id="08"> Religious Myths </a>
<a class="tri" href="#09">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>Religious myths are the most durable of all, because they purport to explain the deepest and most important mysteries of life. We learn them early, and seldom move on. Here are a couple that many of us learned young and never even verbalize thereafter.
</p>



<h4>
<a class="tri" href="#08">&#9651;&emsp;&emsp;</a>
<a href="#TOC"   id="09"> Religious Myth 1. &lsquo;We are a Finished Product.&rsquo; No. </a>
<a class="tri" href="#10">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Creation myths leave the impression that when Coyotl was done playing in the mud, we were a finished product, &lsquo;made in the image of god&rsquo;. Yet as noted <a href="../_A/A04.shtml#07">above</a>, even Genesis radically contradicts itself about the creation of humans. (The confusion is echoed among paleontologists today, for there is no universally accepted description of the speciation event that gave rise to<i> H. sapiens.</i>) Birth is confusing, with no prior frame of reference for individuals or for species. In neither case, however, can the result be considered &lsquo;finished&rsquo;. The nascent human species (<a href="../_A/A01.shtml#F1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>), like human babies, specialized in brain growth, and is still at it.
</p>

<p>When Pope John Paul II said that &lsquo;souls do not evolve&rsquo;, he was not despairing over the failure of the Catholic Church to help its flock move onward, but stating the logical consequence of the Catholic mythology. And what a depressing, hope-destroying, dead-end, world-view it is!
</p>

<p>Naturally, brain growth accelerated our evolution. Over the last few million years, hominids have been the most rapidly changing genetic line on the planet. This will continue as long as we alter our environment &mdash; and in the Anthropocene, we cannot avoid doing that.
</p>

<p>It is only our short perspective that prevents us from seeing ourselves as part of an evolving progression. R.A. Fisher warned about letting undirected evolution &lsquo;<a href="../_D/D13.shtml#14">hammer [us]</a> into most undesirable shapes&rsquo; &mdash; but hammered people deem their shape forged, strong, and desirable. We need to decide where we want to go if we wish to avoid this. Marx understood the malleability of human nature &mdash; but (unlike Virgil) missed the gradient: downhill is easy; uphill hard. Anyone can revert to Middle Paleolithic behavior, because all it takes is Instinct-1. Not only is it difficult to move beyond the ethical norm of the moment, but we tend to poison, crucify, burn, or incarcerate <a class="fn">those who try.<span>
	Consider our despicable treatment of whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange, who tried to move ethics along a little bit. The Jewish prophets were doing exactly the same thing &mdash; criticizing the government of the day for not living up to its own laws and working against its own best interest. We really haven&apos;t made much progress here!
</span></a> </p>

<p>We learn, but slowly. The <cite>Bill of Rights</cite>, while it lasted, was designed specifically to control the known abuses of power by British alpha males. When and as we reinstitute it, we should extend it to cover the more recent abuses invented by corporations and their politicians &mdash; including the abuses used to destroy it.
</p>

<p>When we meet people living as we lived at 60 ka, they want to kill us &mdash; and at least some of us want to study them. This is progress &mdash; and on an evolutionary scale, extremely rapid progress. Reichian armoring &mdash; a reversion to the 60-ka mode &mdash; is one direction we do not want to go, yet the fraction of armored populations is increasing, and they not only have their very own &lsquo;religion&rsquo;, they want to impose it on the rest of us.
</p>

<p>Evolutionary brain growth is coupled to 2 less well understood evolutions. One is that (just as with silicon), carbon brains are always learning how to use their growing ability. The sequence <a class="fn">AMH &rarr; BMH &rarr; CMH<span>
	 &mdash; where &lsquo;A- B- C-MH&rsquo; stand for Anatomically ‚ûõ Bicamerally ‚ûõ Consciously Modern Humans.
</span></a> in <a href="../_C/C10.shtml#F10.1">Fig. 10.1</a> is one aspect of this learning; there is no reason to think the process is complete. The way we educate our children interacts with this process in important ways, that either help or hinder. A great deal of religious education &mdash; Hindu, Islamic, and Christian &mdash; is driven by an inchoate retrograde urge to regain bicameral certainty in a conscious age.
</p>

<p>It is not only the brain that is trying to understand itself. The same seems true of the universe as a whole, with ourselves the only known example of <a class="fn">this effort.<span>
	The ever increasing number of &lsquo;garden exoplanets&rsquo; being discovered around nearby stars suggests strongly that we should not be the only examples of this process, but so far we seem alone. Fermi&apos;s question applies: &lsquo;Where is everybody?&rsquo;
</span></a> Using &lsquo;universe&rsquo; to denote <a href="../_B/B08.shtml#F8.4">Cosmos 6</a>, our universe is privileged to have bits that have become self-conscious and can think about such problems. Most universes may not share this feature, having begun with an inappropriate set of <a class="fn">laws or constants.<span>
	A Vilenkin (2006) <cite>Many Worlds in One</cite> (Hill & Wang, NYC).
</span></a> This is a remarkable process: physics&apos;s 4 fundamental forces and Einstein&apos;s equation convert energy into a zoo of elementary particles; Schr√∂dinger&apos;s equation combines some of them into a periodic table of 92+ chemical elements; molecular-orbital theory allows carbon and its neighbors to form extraordinarily complex molecules; the molecules discover how to cooperate to form replicating structures; the structures become self-aware and outline the steps leading to their formation; and &mdash; what next? It has taken 13.7 Gy to reach this point, and the &lsquo;outline&rsquo; was produced only in the last 150 years. This looks more like the beginning of the complication phase of the story than its climax!
</p>

<p>Millennium-old tribal rules are not the best things to study if we are looking to the future. If any of the approaches recorded in scripture had actually worked after the bicameral consensus failed, we would have examples to follow. As I may have mentioned, Mondrag&oacute;n appears to be the best thing going. It is, in my estimate, &lsquo;what Jesus would do&rsquo; while studying how to get rid of the corporate Romans. Gautama would accept Mondrag&oacute;n as &lsquo;Right Livelihood&rsquo; and &lsquo;Right Effort&rsquo; and &lsquo;Right Attitude&rsquo;. Zoroaster would agree, &lsquo;Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.&rsquo;

 But it is anathema to the handful of people who run the multinational corporations and the governments, so the churches have their work cut out for them.

<p>We do not need a god to tell us how to behave. A simple demonstration of this is that the law&apos;n&apos;order aspect of religion has been with us since Hammurabi&apos;s Code, dictated to him by Shamash, God of Justice, ca. 1760 BCE. This was good law whose elements survive in Judaism, Roman law, and to some extent in shari‚Äòa, even if they are understood by Jews,   Christians, and Moslems as precepts ordained by their own gods. They also survive in modern legal systems &mdash; where scholars, sceptics, and legislators agree in discounting divine input.
</p>

<p>Today we arrive at rules of behavior by <a class="fn">rational analysis<span>
	<i>Pace</i> some State and Federal legislatures. Even ALEC&apos;s laws are rational, given their distorted axioms.
</span></a> and they are in many cases the same rules that Hammurabi heard from Shamash. India was never better governed than by Asoka, whose inspiration was Buddhist and expressly non-theological. Shari‚Äòa, the most god-infested legal system still in existence, legislates for imaginary beings (djinns) and deals unfairly with the bulk of humanity (women, dhimmis, and infidels). In examples I have seen, Shari‚Äòa mandates primitive mirror punishment, as in &lsquo;an eye for an eye&rsquo; {Ex 21:24}, while the Judaic Oral law (arrived at long since by consensus among rabbis) &lsquo;corrupted&rsquo; this &mdash; as Mohamet was at pains to point out &mdash; into a sophisticated five-part monetary compensation paying for &lsquo;Damages, Pain, Medical expenses, Incapacitation, and Mental anguish&rsquo;, as in contemporary US law.
</p>

<p>What does this tell us? A Jaynesian philosopher would observe that Shamash was Hammurabi&apos;s unconscious describing a workable system. The later gods who copied Shamash&apos;s rules were similar bicameral constructs. It follows that the law&apos;n&apos;order aspect of religion is not divine in origin. It was an evolutionary development of the brain, learning to use itself in a way that made society and progress possible &mdash; and showing that the laws, parameters, and initial conditions of this universe at least allow social justice. It is nobody&apos;s fault but our own if we fail to institute it more effectively.
</p>

<p>We can be browbeaten with the threat of punishment by imaginary beings, only so long as we are gullible and irrational. Many philosophers and legislators of the last 2¬Ω millennia have agreed with the brain, claiming that this trickery was necessary. One cannot help but wonder: if we explained the situation to our children, so they grew up understanding evolution, the various operating systems of the brain, the gradually advancing state of human ethics, and their duty to continue this advance &mdash; would it have any effect?
</p>

<p>The reverse process certainly has a deleterious effect. The American South created a parallel system of private Christian schools, K-12 through college, in which evolution is anathema, the 10 Commandments are god-given, and dogma substitutes for research. The result is a sub-population which grows up with a medieval outlook, understands nothing of science, and to all appearances feels lost without its bicameral guide and so hangs on to a literal interpretation of obsolete dogma with a bulldog grip. And runs for Congress!

</span></a> </p>

<p> A pair of long debated ethical hypotheses with mythical answers are: &lsquo;Do the ends justify the means?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Does torture work?&rsquo;. &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, say Instinct-1 and Catholic dogma, &lsquo;their utility is obvious&rsquo;, so Popes of the Inquisition and US Administrations of the early 21st century made them instruments of policy.
</p>

<p>The academic discipline that worries about such things is Moral Philosophy. Despite its abstruse reputation, Moral Philosophy is not a pastime of ivory-tower intellectuals, but the nitty-gritty of international diplomacy. There is an obvious need to understand the practical consequences of the twin hypotheses, yet it seems that there are no definitive historical analyses. (Correct me if I am wrong. Perhaps I haven&apos;t figured out where to look.)

	This subjective judgement obviously depends upon one&apos;s interpretation of the resulting ends. The people involved show no sign of agreeing with me.
</span></a> Starting with the intention of re-establishing the US as the one superpower, they managed, in 8 short years, to reduce us to moral lepers in the world&apos;s eyes, fighting counterproductive wars because we didn&apos;t know how to get out of them, with our economy and Constitution in shambles. Perhaps the best epitaph for the Bush years is the triumphalist version of Pogo&apos;s Predicament: &lsquo;<b>We have <i>defeated</i> the enemy &mdash; and he was us.</b>&rsquo;

<p>Negative answers to the twin hypotheses are ethically clean and intuitively plausible. In the first case, we have &lsquo;The Ends are the time integral of the Means&rsquo;. Symbolically:
</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Ends</i> = ‚à´ <i>Means</i> d<i>t</i>
</p>

<p>This formulation does not prohibit the use of whatever nasty, destructive, and desperate means seem necessary to achieve a particular good end, but it reminds us that power corrupts, and that reliance upon nasty leads to nastiness becoming, in the end, a defining characteristic.
</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Abu Ghraib defense&rsquo; &mdash; that &lsquo;a few bad apples&rsquo; destroyed America&apos;s image as possessor of the moral high ground &mdash; is perfectly true. The apples, however, were at the top of the tree. George W. Bush sanctioned the tortures of Abu Ghraib and Guant√°namo.

<ol>
<li>The interrogation methods approved by the Bush administration, when used on George W. Bush, Karl Rove, John Ashcroft, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and their ilk, will produce signed confessions that they planned and abetted the destruction of the Twin Towers. This is a testable hypothesis, to which they cannot logically object. This does not mean that torture works. One could extract the same confession from any random suspects. One needs prior knowledge of details to separate wheat from chaff here, because a tortured person will ultimately tell you what he thinks you want to know.</li>

<li>True information obtained by torture can also be obtained ethically. As we have <a href="../_E/E19.shtml#40">seen</a>, it was: by the dogged research of one patient detective. Michael Ruppert&apos;s unchallenged 600-page indictment would persuade an open-minded grand jury to charge these people with murder and high treason.</li>

<p>The most effective interrogator of captured Japanese in WW II wrote:

<p class="flu">The same is certainly true of jihadists, except that the time span is not a decade, but centuries or millennia!
</p>

<p>Our advocates of torture cannot adduce one item of useful information obtained by their efforts. Undocumented assertions of &lsquo;terror averted&rsquo; do not qualify. This is what happens when mediocrity obtains executive power: never having thought deeply about anything (especially moral philosophy), it lacks the resources to say &lsquo;No!&rsquo; to active evil.

They announced that they needed a &lsquo;new Pearl Harbor&rsquo; in 2001 &mdash; and they got it. They then announced that they wanted another: On the principle of Cui bono?, we should take this as a declaration of long-term policy, and to protect against it, ensure that their philosophy does not return to power.

<p>How does &lsquo;the right to bear arms&rsquo; protect us from a criminal tyrannical government that:

<li>Has achieved this by waving the flag?

<p>The situation differs only in detail from the one Reinhold Niebuhr describes in <cite>Moral Man And Immoral Society</cite>, where the moral man must renounce his own pacifism to defend his society against, say, Nazis or Feudofascists, on the grounds that <b>social ethics differs from individual ethics</b>.

<p class="epi">A myth is a way of making sense in a senseless world. Myths are narrative patterns that give significance to our existence.&hellip; Myths are our way of finding meaning and significance. Myths are like the beams of a house: not exposed to outside view, they are the structure which holds the house together so people can live in it. &mdash; Rollo May, <cite>The Cry for Myth</cite>.
</p>

<p>One could write analyses like those above for a score of other myths, but this task we leave to the reader&apos;s imagination, limiting commentary to the ranking shown in the tables below.
</p>

<p>No-one explains to us that our culture&apos;s myths are arbitrary. By the time we are old enough to figure that out for ourselves, our childhood &lsquo;ways of thinking about the world&rsquo; are so well established that most of us seem incapable of admitting their arbitrariness, let alone selecting or crafting a better set.
</p>

<p>This failure of vision &mdash; the inability to imagine a better reality, and the consequent postponement of happiness &mdash; has been a principle reason we do not have better lives. Our myths have too often been limited to the fairy tale, in which good fortune shines on an individual, and society goes on unchanged. (This is the real reason governments like lotteries. It is convenient that they raise money, but they are <i>essential</i> to maintaining the hope that postpones revolution.)
</p>

<p>We cannot live without myths, even though in our secular age, we dismiss them as children&apos;s tales and guide our lives by &lsquo;factual reports&rsquo; from TV. Nevertheless, we inescapably see the world through mythic filters, a sampling of which &mdash; ranked by utility &mdash; are shown in Tables 24.1&ndash;3. Note how few are positively useful. If our mythic ideals are destructive, can we expect reality to be any better?

<p>Clearly, some of these negative myths were useful at one time, and some contain a large proportion of truth. &lsquo;Be fruitful and multiply&rsquo; goes back 70 million years, to a time

<blockquote>
<span class="sp3">When we were still insectivores,
</span><br>
<span class="sp3">And snacks for infant dinosaurs,</span><br>
<span class="sp3">We wanted all the children we could breed.

<span class="sp3">But now sustainability</span><br>
<span class="sp3">Puts limits on fertility:</span><br>
<span class="sp3">The population&apos;s triple what we need.
</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p class="flu">It is only in the last century, as we strain the limits of the world, that this myth has gone bad.
</p>

<p>There are, rarely, just wars (and perhaps even justifiable pre-emptive strikes), particularly when Instinct-1 leads megalomaniacs to announce their intentions before acting destructively. Adam Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; works well when there are a multitude of decision-makers and marketable products &mdash; but fails for oligopolies and the commons. The &lsquo;trickle-down&rsquo; theory is pure trickery: there are enough high-risk mutual funds to fuel innovative start-ups, which is the function most often claimed as justification for allowing the super-rich to survive &mdash; and the rich mostly put their money into tax-free and risk-free investments. Some forms of Christianity are an improvement over some alternatives. Technology is beneficial when accompanied by social mechanisms which rescue people <a class="fn">sandbagged<span>
	E.g.: How do we expect people to make a living when half of all manual, clerical, and professional jobs are performed better and more cheaply by robots and software? We need to think about this!
</span></a> by its side effect. The American Dream, when it was &lsquo;a nation conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&rsquo;, was the culmination of the Enlightenment.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we seem to take all of these myths equally seriously. Bad myths that are profitable or politically useful will be assiduously propagated and defended by our culture. Public discussion of the demerits of a myth ranked &#8209;2 or lower will be met with opprobrium and harassment.

<p>Marx&apos;s ideas, considered as testable hypotheses rather than as truths to be imposed willy-nilly, contributed many constructive ideas to the modern nation states, progressive income tax and universal compulsory education among them. Instinct-1 finds these anathema, reluctant as always to do anything that is not accompanied by immediate profit, especially if it helps others.

<p>Colonialism, in the hands of the postmoderns, has received a very bad press. Yet as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110419194434/http://frontline.org.za/articles/zim-Lesson_in_how_to_Destroy_Christian_Civilisation.htm" class="fn">Peter Hammond<span>

</span></a> pointed out, &lsquo;the most obvious ‚Äúscars of colonialism‚Äù have included: roads, railways, bridges, schools, hospitals, churches, law courts, shops, written languages, medicines, the Gospel, the wheel &hellip;&rsquo;. A generation ago, Rhodesia was a prosperous, food-exporting country where no-one bothered to lock a door. For a few years &mdash; recreated as Zimbabwe, as much by Western acquiescence and misplaced guilt as by Communist arms and Mugabe&apos;s shock treatment &mdash; with hyperinflation, most of its wildlife lost to bush meat, half of its population fled and the remainder unemployed and starving, it seemed an outstanding example of the power of bad myths. By mid-2013, things had sorted themselves out a bit, farms had recovered, and Zimbabwe was beginning to feed its reduced population.
</p>

<p>At this point it is useful to look at the attempt by The Fund for Peace to quantify &lsquo;state failure&rsquo;. A glance at the &lsquo;Fragile States Index&rsquo;<a href="http://fundforpeace.org/"> summary map</a> shows good agreement with Western bias. The countries where I have spent the most time in recent decades all rank lower (=fewer problems) than the US; the low-ranking countries are those that promulgate Enlightenment values; the high-ranking countries (=many problems) are places I have avoided or been glad to get out of. Is this bias or reality? The initial analysis is automated; the proprietary Conflict Assessment Software Tool scans relevant material (millions of publications annually: news reports, statistical data, government publications, etc), &lsquo;detailing the existing social, economic and political pressures faced by each of the 178 countries&rsquo; in terms of some 168 topics in 12 major categories. The results are correlated with major events in the country, vital statistics, and human analysis.
</p>

<p>Software inevitably reflects the bias of its authors, so that a failed-states index written by Islamists would show an entirely different ranking. Here one must look at the historical record: which countries have contributed most to human welfare &mdash; by your own idiosyncratic definition of &lsquo;welfare&rsquo;. If you feel that Sudan is not the poster boy of failed states, but is successfully implementing the will of Allah as the most important of human duties, then by all means, move to Sudan, and thank The Fund for Peace for identifying your utopia.
</p>

<p>All in all, it is hard to think of a better way to integrate massive amounts of disparate data. Critics who have described the results as &lsquo;nonsense on stilts&rsquo; &mdash; apparently from disagreement with particular rankings &mdash; have not suggested a better approach.
</p>

<p>The urge to blame the failed states of the world on anything but homegrown incompetence is very strong. Instinct-1 will take advantage of anyone it can, and where there is money to be made by exploitation, foreign entrepreneurs support the most venal natives available. FDR said it of the Dominican Republic&apos;s Trujillo, Nixon of Panama&apos;s Noriega, and Truman of Nicaragua&apos;s Somoza: &lsquo;He may be a bastard, but he&apos;s <i>our</i> bastard!&rsquo; Castro took Cuba &mdash; the first banana republic to escape US control &mdash; a long way from the kleptocracy of <a class="fn">Batista<span>
	Unfortunately using surplus Cuban males to export Communism-by-force in Africa.
</span></a> (Eisenhower&apos;s bastard). Cuba would have done much better without the sour-grapes embargo by the US, but our capitalists are terrified by any socialist success. Having said that, the only southern-hemisphere states to make into the &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; rank of <cite>Foreign Policy&apos;s</cite> annual &lsquo;Failed States&rsquo; list are Australia and New Zealand, while nearly all Africa and Islamic-belt states are in deep trouble.

<p> Myths which are actually working for our benefit are harder to come by, perhaps because many have moved beyond the point at which they can be classed in any way as mythic. Surprisingly, science is still not understood as a <i>method</i> by many people, but as just another <i>belief system</i> in conflict with their own. This has political repercussions, because we elect politicians who are similarly confused. This also means that many people still live in a 17th-century world with magical toys &mdash; once again, a massive failure of elementary education.

<a href="#TOC"   id="18"> An Unpopular Vision of God </a>
<a class="tri" href="#19">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>We have several times mentioned the odd ideas that &lsquo;god is an equation&rsquo; and &lsquo;mathematics lies at the root of existence&rsquo;. Such statements carry little information for most people, for whom math is either impenetrable, or at best a powerful tool in their daily work. If the functions of myth are making the world understandable and meaningful, dragging in mathematics is not going to help. Nevertheless, these ideas seem likely to merge, one of these years, into a working cosmotheology, accessible only to a select few for whom mathematics is not an impediment but a stairway.
</p>

<p>Historically, because myth lacks the built-in reality checks of science, we were free to tell ourselves stories that magnified our importance. Then came the Enlightenment and analysis, and every time we replaced a bit of myth with a bit of knowledge, the world became more understandable &mdash; but less meaningful. We chipped away at our fictitious importance, and for most people, the loss of importance was matched by a loss of comprehension, because the price of the knowledge was mastering mathematics. All that resulted was the loss of emotional meaning, direct and personal; any gain of intellectual understanding was remote and abstract. &lsquo;Popularizing science&rsquo; is an anodyne, not a cure, for the resulting malaise. It may help, or it may only put a rationalizing gloss on what is indistinguishable from magic. The suggested cure has been to acquire sufficient maturity to face a meaningless universe and stare it down. We have not found this easy. The real cure is even more of a challenge: If no one else is going to put meaning into the universe for us, we must once again do it ourselves with <a class="fn">myth and vision<span>
	The range of suggested visions is large, from Islam&apos;s lowest-common-denominator afterlife of sexual indulgence through Buddhist reabsorption of individuality into the godhead to science-fiction&apos;s star-faring ownership of the galaxy. The trick is to pick one that can most powerfully inspire us to work for the essential immediate goals of the preceding chapters.
</span></a> &mdash; no longer unonsciously, but intentionally, by our bootstraps.
</p>

<p>The fact that the world is comprehensible was, for Einstein, its only truly incomprehensible feature. Astonished by this, he apparently overlooked the tradition of Pythagoras, Plato, Bacon, Spinoza, and others who sensed intuitively the significance of this fact. More recently, John Archibald Wheeler, Roger Penrose, Alex Vilenkin, Ed Fredkin, and Max Tegmark have carried the Pythagorean banner, perceiving an ideal abstraction behind the phenomenal world. Of these, Tegmark is among the least mystical, with his flat assertion that the reason mathematics describes the real world so well is that the only &lsquo;things&rsquo; that can appear in the physical world are those describable by mathematics &mdash; or perhaps only by <i>computational</i> mathematics.

<p>Annoying as it may be, it seems inevitable that theological progress will increasingly require familiarity with the cutting edge of mathematics, making Fig. 24.2 a necessary aspect of any meaningful theology. This is why Stephen Hawking describes cosmology as trying to see into the mind of god. So far, this attempt to tie god and math together may seem a far fetched and purely scholastic exercize, much like the earlier problem of enumerating the angels dancing on a pinhead. However, it raises an interesting possibility.
</p>

<p> If Fig. 24.2 is (part of) the structure of god, G√∂del&apos;s Theorem tells us that there are questions which can be posed, but not answered, without extending the structure. In this case, to maintain any semblance of the customary attribute of
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im"  src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="NewIdea"></a>
omniscience, gods must evolve and learn, just like the rest of the Universe, so the idea of an eternally static god must be abandoned. We knew this already about the preferred god of the last 2 millennia (and assumed it in the front end papers), because the Israelite prophets succeeded in housebreaking YHVH &mdash; who was nearly identical to Allah when they got him. Even so, it is a useful thought to keep in mind when contemplating mythopoesis, because no myth known to me describes this aspect of divinity.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is little here of warmth or comfort or guidance. When we discovered this lack in earlier days, we met it by redefining our gods: We dropped Anu for Ea and Enlil; Indra for Vishnu and Shiva; Ouranos for Zeus and the Olympians, because we prefer meddling anthropomorphic gods to abstract impersonal constructs.
</p>

<p>The US response to the 18th-century recognition of the <i>deus absconditus</i> was limbic camp meetings that annihilated the Deist god of the Enlightenment and Constitution. This retrogression seems unnecessarily desperate! A more interesting and productive response might be the realization that while the mill of the gods grinds slowly, we are fortunate to be present at the most dramatic moment of its grinding. It is not hubris to claim that <i>H. sapiens</i> is (to the best of our knowledge) the supreme achievement of the universe, paltry as that may seem after 13 billion years of development. The European response &mdash; nihilism (nothing matters) and postmodernism (anything goes) &mdash; was cortical, infantile, and premature. If the stories (of Judaeochristian inherited guilt and vicarious atonement; or of an Islamic god so insecure that he wanted to abase the world 50 times daily), have proven empty, there is still a great deal to be done. Before we look at what that is, it is useful to examine what it took to get where we are.

<p class="epi"> It was our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence &hellip; to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man. &mdash;  John L. O&apos;sullivan, (1845, 1839)
</p>

<p>It is less than 2 centuries since O&apos;sullivan first clearly enunciated the idea of a United States that spread from coast to coast, coupled to <a class="fn">de Tocqueville&apos;s<span>
	A de Toqueville (1840) <cite>Democracy in America</cite>, transl. H Reeve (Penn State Electronic Classic, University Park, PA, 2002): 510.
</span></a> insight that we had a national mission to spread a particular vision across the world:
</p>

<blockquote>I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst the rest of the nation, enjoying more leisure and less harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind. The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one.
</blockquote>

<p>This passage is the first journalistic mention of American exceptionalism and its English roots. It is a misprision, because the exceptional roots are not English, they are Enlightenment, but the error was not de Tocqueville&apos;s, who merely reported the attitude we saw in <a href="../_E/E19.shtml#01">Wannabe Barons</a>. We had the first government since the Antonines designed from scratch to govern for the benefit of the governed and to seek the general welfare: most of us were content to explore the personal possibilities of such a gift, and it did not occur to us that we were setting an example to the world. Nor did we realize how easily the design could be subverted. But then, de Toqueville did note that thinking &mdash; particularly, perhaps, long-term thinking &mdash; was not part of America&apos;s exceptionalism.
</p>

<p>Our mission was not the minor charge of exploring the wilds of the New World. Nor was it any that we seem to have become known for &mdash; gangster capitalism, sweatshop colonialism, household armories, adolescent Coca-Culture, &lsquo;colateral damage&rsquo;, and bullying. What O&apos;sullivan called &lsquo;moral dignity&rsquo; and &lsquo;salvation of man&rsquo; can also be seen as the redeeming knowledge that <b><i>Libert√©, Egalit√©,

<a class="tri" href="#20">&#9651;&emsp;&emsp;</a>
<a href="#TOC"   id="21"> 2. Antaios </a>
<a class="tri" href="#22">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>Antaios first appears in western mythology as an incident among the Labors of Hercules. He was a Berber king, son of Gaia and Poseidon (goddess of the Earth and god of the Sea, respectively) in the days before Poseidon was adopted into the Olympian pantheon as brother of Zeus, and Gaia sent back to live in the caves. In the Roman version he is known as Anteus, a giant and miscreant wrestler who took advantage of the fact that as long as he was in contact with the ground he was invincible. Hercules killed him by lifting him off the ground in a bear hug and breaking his back. This seems to be a late version of the story.
</p>

<p>According to Euripides&apos;s earlier version, Antaios was invincible while in contact with either land or sea. He kept order in Libya (a generic term for North Africa in those days) by inviting the leaders of nomad raiding bands to one-on-one wrestling, killing them, and in an attempt to deter others, placing their skulls on the frieze of a temple to Gaia. Unfortunately, this deterred no one, because (just as in the American West) there was always another challenger, sure of his own skills.
</p>

<p>Herakles was the prototypical killer of wildlife (the Lion of Nemea, centaurs, Stymphalian birds), drainer of swamps (the Lernean Hydra), and polluter of rivers (the Stables of Augeas) &mdash; and son of Zeus, who never liked the idea of sharing control of the world with his brother Poseidon. Consequently, when Eurystheus sent Heracles off on his Labors, he had additional instructions from Zeus to do what he could to reduce Poseidon&apos;s influence, so he killed every offspring of Poseidon whom he came across during the Labors, Antaios among them. Gaia was not happy about this. Appearing in the guise of an old woman, too late to save her son, she placed a geas on Herakles: he would go mad, kill his wife Megara, and their children Creontiades, Deico√∂n, Ophitus, and Therimachus. Herakles, thinking Gaia only an old woman and probably mad herself, dismisses her with ridicule. Upon returning from his Labors (and in another play, <cite>Herakles mainomenos</cite>), the geas catches up with him, he goes mad, and kills his family.
</p>

<p>Amongst all the killing, the key point is made quietly. It is neither the strength of Heracles nor his mission that brings about the death of Antaios,
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im"
	src="../Images/K-TakeHome3.gif" alt="TakeHome"></a>
but his separation from and loss of contact with Gaia. Whatever this may have meant to classical Athens, its meaning to us is clear.

</span></a> identified the root cause of our environmental problems as unwarranted arrogance at the core of Christian theology:
</p>

<blockquote>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. &mdash; Gen. 1:28
</blockquote>

<p>It may be that <i>multiply</i> is the more destructive process, but for now we concentrate on <i>dominion</i>. The Republican epigraph is Instinct-1 in full cry, the attitude responsible for most of our current crises: self-centered greed untrammeled by awareness that the root <i>domus</i> means &lsquo;house&rsquo;. Among <a class="fn">civilized people,<span>
	Virginia and Canada, perhaps?
</span></a> <i>dominion</i> evokes not corporate jackboots but domestic leadership. What the original word was, and what language it was in, are unknowable. Versions in Phoenician and Aramaic, centuries earlier than Hebrew and Greek, are themselves millennia later than the campfires. The Vulgate&apos;s <i>praesit</i>, &lsquo;let him lead&rsquo; is supernally better than the Hebrew&apos;s <i>rada</i>, commonly glossed as &lsquo;a primitive root; to run after (usually with hostile intent)&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>In any case, it is rash to assume that a word so variously translated is a prescription for behavior. The fact that every prior cultures that has taken this advice to heart has collapsed into obscurity might suggest that stewardship &mdash; consideration for the benefit of the Earth &mdash; might be a more successful concept than domination. (Note in this context that Judaism &mdash; unlike the Republicans &mdash; did not mindlessly embrace this concept, but <a href="F22.shtml#23">as we have seen</a> was the first culture to consider what it really meant.)

</span></a> seems to be the most coherent (and useful) interpretation available. It shows that the Pauline interpretation of 1:28 overlooks a great deal of theological history. The 2nd Creation Story (Gen. 2:4 ff) reveals Adams&apos;s purpose &mdash; which is not to praise or worship YHVH (who is sufficiently self-confident not to need such blather), nor to obey him (had automatons been wanted, they would have been created).

	<li>The volume of water removed was 3.3 times that of the remaining ocean. This had been delivered through the &lsquo;fountains of the deep&rsquo; and the &lsquo;windows of heaven&rsquo; {7:11}, but there is no mention of where it went, so presumably it returned to the deep and the windows, but there are puzzles.</li>

	<li>Thermodynamics: While the augmented ocean seems deep, in planetary terms it it comparable to a sheet of paper on a model globe of the earth. Presumably the &lsquo;deep&rsquo; is the upper mantle, capable of holding a certain amount of water.) However, dehydrating the mantle and rehydrating it cannot both be spontaneous processes. One of them requires energy. Attempts today to insert even small amounts of seawater into the mantle are emphatically resisted (e.g., Krakatoa). How did the water return to the deep?</li>

	<li>The water above the firmament must have been in vapor form. How was this compressed sufficiently to precipitate as rain? Again, evaporating it later requires manipulation of solar output, increasing it to remove the excess water, and returning to normal at the right moment. How was this managed?</li>

<p>The 1st Task is unequivocal: <span class="rc">YHVH took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden to cultivate and take care of it.</span> Soon we find &lsquo;YHVH walking in the garden in the cool of the day&rsquo; (Gen. 3:8). This is as good an answer as we have yet found to the existential question, &lsquo;Why is there something rather than nothing?&rsquo;. It is an even better answer to the existential question, &lsquo;What can we do today to make the future more secure?&rsquo;

<p><a class="fn">Gottwald<span>
	NK Gottwald (1987) <cite>The Hebrew Bible: A socio-literary introduction</cite> (Fortress, Philadelphia): 31.1.
</span></a> emphasizes this Task&apos;s central nature: &lsquo;<i>adam</i>, ‚Äúthe human being‚Äù, is none other than the cultivator of the <i>adamah</i>, ‚Äúthe ground/soil‚Äù&rsquo;. The story of the Fall &lsquo;does not permit any simplistic equation of work or sexuality with ‚Äúsin‚Äù and its ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù&rsquo; &mdash; but Gottwald did not make the obvious connection that the Fall was the consequence of failing the 3 Tasks.

<a href="#TOC"   id="24"> Taxonomy </a>
<a class="tri" href="#25">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>The 2nd Task is unequivocal. Adam was appointed court taxonomist: <span class="rc">&lsquo;So from the soil YHVH fashioned all the wild animals and all the birds of heaven. These he brought to the man to see what he would call them; each one was to bear the name the man would give it&rsquo;.</span> We didn&apos;t take this seriously until the days of Linnaeus and Darwin, and we haven&apos;t completed it yet. Fundamentalists are content to stop at 7 in their naming of &lsquo;kinds&rsquo;; taxonomists have reached 3 million and suspect 10 million.
</p>

<p>Taxonomy &mdash; which is more than naming, and includes understanding the evolutionary relationships of the natural world &mdash; is basic to understanding our place in the world; otherwise we think we are unique and special to Coyotl, leading to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supernal arrogance;</li>
<li>the assumption that we can do as we wish to the natural world;</li>
<li>the fond hope that some god will support the dividends of Big Oil by magically tinkering with the vibrotational energy levels of CO‚ÇÇ so that it does not cook us, <i>without</i> simultaneously altering them to the extent that our respiratory enzymes asphyxiate us;</li>

</h4>

<p>The 3rd Task was misunderstood. YHVH&apos;s first try was the trouble-making &lsquo;multiply &hellip; subdue &hellip; dominion&rsquo; of Gen 1:28. He was thinking &lsquo;dominion&rsquo; as in <i>domus</i>, household, not as in Paul&apos;s &lsquo;We are the only important part of the system&rsquo;. Taking the Bible at its word and assuming a <a class="fn" href="http://pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2115.pdf">1% growth rate,<span>
	1% is 1/3 that of contemporary Hagarenes, and too small to notice until statistics was invented. [Click for statistics.]
</span></a> we find that &lsquo;people began being numerous on earth&rsquo; {Gen. 6:1} implies a 14-million-fold increase during the 1656 &lsquo;biblical years&rsquo; between Adam and Noah {Gen. 5; 9:28}. The result was that &lsquo;human wickedness was great on earth and human hearts contrived nothing but wicked schemes all day long&rsquo; {Gen. 6:5}, so YHVH decided to start over: &lsquo;I shall rid the surface of the earth of the human beings whom I created &hellip;&rsquo; {Gen. 6:7}, &lsquo;for the earth is full of lawlessness because of hum

 Nevertheless, Noah saves his family, animals, and birds {Gen. 7:2,3}.
</p>

<p>If we started with one human pair, YHVH killed 29 million people in 40 days, establishing a Sustained Daily Kill record (716,000/day) which serial murderers, armies, jihadists, etc, can only envy. Allah&apos;s best day was only 100,000 &mdash; by proxy (Timur, in 1399, a record that still stands). This may be one reason for Allah&apos;s perpetual inferiority complex: He can but dream of days like YHVH&apos;s! The <a class="fn">70 million<span>

[Many influential Muslims do not want this history known, as it puts a serious crimp in &lsquo;the religion of peace&rsquo; claim.]
	His numbers h/p>

<p>After correcting overpopulation, YHVH tried again, telling Noah: <span class="rc">&lsquo;Bring out [from the Ark] all the animals with you, all living things &hellip; for THEM to swarm on earth, for THEM to breed and multiply on earth&rsquo;</span> {Gen. 8:17}. Those who still cite 1:28 are working from a version obsolete for 7 millennia. <a class="fn">Odum<span>
	E Odum (1993) <cite>Ecology and Our Endangered Life-Support System</cite>, 2nd ed. (Sinauer, Sunderland MA): 277.
</span></a> noted a time and place for each interpretation, so the sequence in Genesis has ecological support. Logic demands Gaian stewardship: If you had just created 10 million species, and had another 200 million planets to look after in the local galaxy, would you not say to the putatively intelligent species on this one, &lsquo;Keep an eye on things for me while I‚Äôm gone, and make whatever adjustments are needed to keep the place running smoothly&rsquo;? What else is an intelligent species for? (The Instinct-1 logic of Christian fundamentalists led an academic among them to explain patiently: &lsquo;The animals are supposed to multiply so we can eat them.&rsquo; This is religion for crocodiles &mdash; or, considering the number of beetles &mdash; for <a class="fn">insectivores.<span>
	YHVH&apos;s &lsquo;inordinate fondness for beetles&rsquo; means that we have named some 450,000 species of them. Our ancestors may have eaten them in Euarchontian days (88 Ma: the tree-shrew is the earliest animal to have the deformed human ear); currently they are eaten by 80% of the world, usually as larvae.
</span></a> Fundamentalists apparently still live in the world of the hunter-gatherers, praying for the chance to kill something to eat.
</p>

<p>In contrast to many Gaian suggestions which do not cite Scripture, the Three Tasks offer a way to persuade rank-and-file members of the Abrahamic religions that the fundamental Scriptural function of humanity is the stewardship of nature. Are there really no theologians alive with the vision and stature to undertake this task? Biblical support is so obvious that the pre-eminence of stewardship can be introduced as the long-overlooked point of the teachings. <b>No new ideas needed.</b>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Adam &mdash; and his descendants &mdash; failed at all 3 Tasks. It is moot whether established Christian sects have botched their Gaian or their Eirenic responsibilities more dismally. Akhnaton, Zoroaster, and Francis of Assisi understood that Man was not separate from Nature, but Paul, seeing the animist associates of the Graeco-Roman pantheons as competitors, enthusiastically attacked anything associated with a nature spirit and insisted that nature was mere raw material for human exploitation.
</p>

<p>As we saw <a href="F21.shtml#17">earlier</a>, the theological aspect of the 10 Commandments was limited to ritual, and they were otherwise simple rules for keeping tribal peace. In Adam&apos;s Tasks we have far more fundamental information: YHVH tells us exactly why he created us. It is not just theology; it also makes sense. Whether by intent, or the inner logic of evolutionary complexity, it seems natural that (whatever the Student Goddesses had in mind)  there should at some point appear an organism with enough smarts
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im"
	src="../Images/K-TakeHome3.gif" alt="TakeHome"></a>
to dress and keep the planetary garden. 8000 years ago we thought that was us!
</p>

<p>Yet despite the logic <b>and the direct explanation</b> we have ignored the instruction and failed, miserably, to carry out the Tasks. And so we were run out of Paradise, to learn the hard way that we need to take care of what we were given. (It took a particularly sick misogynistic mind to have warped this episode into the Christian story of &lsquo;original sin&rsquo;: unfortunately Aquinas rose to the <a class="fn">occasion,<span>
	<cite>Summa Theologica</cite>, Prima Secund√¶ Partis, Question 82.

<p>The apparent conflict between the insights of Religion and Science arises from 10,000 years of linguistic drift. Translating the stories of 8000 BCE into today&apos;s terms, we have:
</p>

<ul class="u1">
<li><b>2:1</b> By <b>Elohim</b> we understand the underlying rules of cosmology, astrodynamics, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and evolution that got us from the quantum fluctuation to the Middle Paleolithic.</li>
<li><b>Consequently, any serious theology curriculum needs to incorporate these disciplines.</b><br><br></li>

<li><b>2:7</b> By <b>soul</b> we understand the Paleolithic Transition which raised us out of the animal regime <i>and made us aware of this fact.</i> (Oddly, this places the creation of humanity at 35ka, early for theologians, late for paleontologists.)</li>
<li><b>Consequently, any serious theology curriculum would include anthropology and paleontology.</b><br><br></li>

<li><b>2:15</b> By <b>gardener-in-chief</b>; we understand one of 2 things (if they are in any way distinguishable). One is that the Elohim had gone to a lot of work, creating 10 million species to occupy an infrastructure of 10 million econiches on <i>this</i> planet, and wanted some local expertise to keep it running smoothly while they went about their business. Alternatively, the one intelligent species on the planet figured out that since they were the only one capable of forethought, they had only themselves to blame if they couldn&apos;t achieve a stable, sustainable, system.</li>
<li><b>Consequently, any serious theology curriculum would teach taxonomy, ecology, and basic planetary stewardship.</b><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Someone, 8000 years ago, had a very clear view of how things were supposed to work out. Our theological schools should be ashamed of not keeping up.

<p>It is clear from the early stages of Table 24.6 that emergence is not limited to biology, but permeates all experience. It is a more compelling drama than anything the religions of earth have come up with, and it has the advantages of being demonstrably true. It is also a deeply mysterious ongoing story, with its roots in what appears to be a basic principle that produces order out of <a class="fn">chaos.<span>
	Remember that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics (&lsquo;Entropy always increases&rsquo;) applies to closed systems, not the open systems of Table 24.2, with energy flowing through them.
</span></a> Granted, not all emergences are beneficial: the 2 varieties of parasitism show that regression is also possible. There is little we can do about biological parasites (Fig. 24.3) except try to minimize their effects; in any case, evolution eventually turns them into obligate symbionts, mutually <a class="fn">beneficial.<span>
	E.g.: our <i>E. coli </i>make Vitamin K, and
	help generate &lsquo;body&rsquo; heat.
</span></a> This process is too slow for social parasites. The most pressing social challenge we face is the <a class="fn">economic inequality<span>
	An irresistible comparison with the little bloodsucker of Fig. 24.3. We really need to eliminate the tendency to think of bankers as benevolent!
</span></a> created by vampirobankers, and the determination of its beneficiaries to usurp the political system. Genetic reduction by excision of phenotypes might be the most expeditious cure.

<p>Vampirobankers and glitches aside, in Emergence we have a theme which offers a coherent process for some of the most difficult questions philosophers have wrestled with separately: the origin of life, the mind-body problem, consciousness, the nature of evil, the origin of religion. Here materialism and spirituality not only blend, but become indistinguishable. Whatever the process, whatever the reason, emergence &mdash; the inability of the universe not to produce something surprising out of the mundane &mdash; connects our hopes and dreams to Table 24.6.

<p>The <a href="#19">Exemplary Myths</a>, whatever their merits, pale before the universality and scope of the Emergence theme. Blake and Chardin sensed its possibilities but had no idea of its epic range across time and category.  Few have sensed the implications of guidance that it offers:
</p>

<blockquote>The evolutionary evidence both from our past and from other species, all who have had to pass the evolutionary test over cumulative lifetimes, is the best indication we can hope to avail ourselves of in assessing our own directions and course of action in future. &mdash; <a class="fn">
	C Fielder, C King (2004) <span>
	<cite>Sexual Paradox</cite> ISBN: 1-4116-5532-X p 40.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">The propensity of Emergence for capitalizing upon mistakes (endosymbiosis, metazoa), and its preponderance of pleasant surprises, combine to produce scientific justification for our impression of divine benevolence. The effectiveness of immune systems in countering biological parasites and the ability of democratic institutions to control economic parasites gives us hope that their epidemics and financial depredations are indeed mere glitches that medicine, law, and eternal vigilance can learn to surmount.
</p>

<p>The inadvertent nature of parasitism &mdash; a mere epiphenomenon of opportunity &mdash; helps us forgive viruses and vampirobankers. &lsquo;They know not what they do&rsquo;, and (certainly for the pathogens, perhaps excusably for the social parasites) have no control over their actions. This should also help both us and them realize that in eradicating them (by whatever means) we are only cleaning up minor problems in an otherwise remarkably <a class="fn">smooth process.<span>
	&lsquo;Minor&rsquo; should not impede out efforts to exterminate both the proximate and ultimate causes of, say, polio and white-collar crime &mdash; polluted water and bad DNA in one case; bad laws, bad parenting, and bad DNA in the other.

</span></a> </p>

<p>Important as prior emergences have been, four that presumably lie ahead are the ones that matter. The experience of modern physics may offer a suggestion about encouraging emergence, for some of our most important discoveries have been made as mathematical possibilities. One might take this as a strong suggestion that the ideal world of Plato and Penrose and Tegmark is more fundamental than the world we perceive directly. Among such discoveries:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Relativity</b> emerged from the mathematical analysis of Albert Einstein;</li>

<li><b>Schr√∂dinger&apos;s equation</b> emerged from the mathematical modelling of the early quantum chemists;</li>

<li><b>Black holes</b> emerged from the mathematical analyses of German physicist Karl Schwarzchild;</li>

<li><b>Big Bang cosmology</b> emerged from the mathematical analyses of Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lema√Ætre;</li>

<li><b>Anti-matter</b> emerged from the mathematical analyses of quantum physicist Paul Dirac;</li>

<li>The <b>Higgs field</b> emerged from Peter Higgs&apos;s mathematical studies seeking a mechanism to endow particles with mass.</li>
</ul>


<p>If it be thought that these emergences are esoteric matters of no practical import, neither Google Maps nor smartphones would exist without them. Some of the others have the power to upset all of our fond opinions about our own importance.
</p>

<p>Granted, the arithmetic of physics is simpler than the arithmetic of sociology. But there is nothing novel about the hope that we might couple the power of tomorrow&apos;s supercomputer networks to sophisticated statistical models of society. Isaac Asimov&apos;s  alter ego Hari Seldon (of the multi-volume <a class="fn" href="http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/foundation/author/asimov/first-edition/bx/sortby/1/page-1/" (as of 2013-08-02).><cite>Foundation</cite><span>
	I Asimov (1951) <cite>Foundation</cite> (Gnome Press, NYC).<br>
	Asimov claimed that small, struggling Gnome Press never paid him for <cite>Foundation</cite>. Today a copy of that edition sells for $25,000.
</span></a> series) discovered the equations of &lsquo;psychohistory&rsquo;, and found that they predicted a &lsquo;Decline and Fall of the [Galactic] Empire&rsquo;, and a subsequent Dark Age &mdash; which could be shortened by the activity of &lsquo;the Foundation&rsquo; of the series&apos;s title. The idea of being able to treat sociology statistically is a seductive one that has been reinvented a number of times: van Gelderen and de Wolff in 1913, Kondratiev in 1925, &lsquo;cliometrics&rsquo; ~1960, and most recently, <a class="fn">cliodynamics.<span>
	P Turchin (2012) &lsquo;Dynamics of political instability in the United States, 1780&ndash;2010&rsquo; <cite>J Peace Res</cite> <b>49</b>: 577&ndash;591.
</span></a> Is this a possibility &mdash; or merely blind hope? Most historians point to inadequate data, complex interactions, and chaos theory as rendering mathematical analysis <a class="fn">meaningless.<span>
	Asimov was careful to posit that psychohistory worked only for large numbers &mdash; millions of planetary systems, quadrillions of people, with 50,000 years of data. It would not work for a single planet, where, for instance, the outcome of a war could be influenced by a Churchill or a Roosevelt.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>However, as a conceptual step for the future, we might redefine all of our conjectural political systems (however absurd they might appear to others) &mdash; Communism, Socialism, Cooperation, New Deal, Mondrag&oacute;n, Free market, Feudofascism, Globalism, Shari‚Äòa and the currently popular Obstructionism &mdash; as formal hypotheses which might
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im"
	src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research road sign"></a>
eventually be falsified by computational sociology. We would no longer have to pretend that they were panaceas, or try to force them on society. Their advocates and opponents could run competing simulations, instead of killing people. Competing programs accepting consensus initial conditions should eventually learn to track ongoing events (in the manner of the world&apos;s weather-predicting computers). As we learn to predict the outcome of minor issues in small constituencies,
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"> <img class="im"
	src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research roadsign"/></a>
we move on to more important issues and larger communities.
</p>

<p>The mathematical details need not concern us. There are many approaches, running from simple approval voting to complex simulations yet to be developed, perhaps finding a socially acceptable use for the massive personal data accumulated by the national spying agencies and internet data  miners, giving their managers and cryptographers a legitimate occupation that would readmit them to <a class="fn">polite society.<span>
	The programmers, at least, are likely to belong to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) &mdash; if only by virtue of subscribing to one of the technical journals. Nevertheless, the code of ethics of the ACM lists 24 moral imperatives &lsquo;formulated as statements of personal responsibility&rsquo;, including<br>
	&bull; 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.<br>
	&bull; 1.7 Respect the privacy of others.<br>
	This is the commitment that must have nagged at Edward Snowden. (What happened to the rest of you guys?)
</span></a>
</p>

<p>The beauty of such an approach is that if properly deployed it can be studied in detail before being applied. One things that we have learned from stolen Presidential elections is that any computer program involved <i>must</i> be open source: Proprietary software cannot be trusted to behave in the public interest.
</p>

<p>If an outsider can outline a project like this, you can be sure that others are already working on malicious versions for power and profit. David Brin (one of the authors who tied up the loose ends of Asimov&apos;s <cite>Foundation</cite> series) has a <a class="fn" href="http://davidbrin.blogspot.fr/2013/01/inventing-hari-seldons-psychohistory.html" (as of 2013-09-17)>monitory blog<span>

<p>While the prior emergents of Table 24.6 were essential to our existence and current society, the further emergents of Table 24.7 are necessary for our survival. They will not happen automatically, because current laws and culture militate strongly against ethics and sustainability. Despite 40-odd years of sustained attempts to educate our alpha males, we have not persuaded them that the survival of our ecological support systems is more important than their personal greed. Any rational small-scale society would have quietly exercized its immemorial right to assassinate such people. We haven&apos;t even slapped their wrists.
