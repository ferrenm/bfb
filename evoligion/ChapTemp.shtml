F. Becula never let his seminary training, MIT doctorate, or thalassochemical career interfere with his curiosity. His working years (30~60) taught him that science answered <i>How Come?</i> but not <i>Why?</i>, and that theology answered <i>Why?</i> from an indeterminate base.</p><p>He devoted a third of his thinking years (60~90) to <i>Why?</i> before (like many others) accepting projection: gods are very like us. His professorial interpretation has them seeking experimental answers to a difficult problem.</p><p>Descended from the bards of the Lord of the Isles, Becula combines Gravesian mythopoiesis and, e.g., the:</p><ul style="list-style-type : none ;"><li>evolutionary biology of Lynn Margulis,</li><li>primatology of Allison Jolly,</li><li>human ecology of Garrett Hardin,</li><li>psychology of Wilhelm Reich,</li><li>sociology of Herbert Gintis,</li><li>geopsychology of James DeMeo,</li><li>bicamerality of Julian Jaynes,</li><li>Gaian vision of James Lovelock,</li><li>Enlightened aspirations of the Founding Fathers,</li><li>intuition of mathematicians from Plato to Tegmark,</li><li>and a nod to quantum field theory,</li></ul><p>into a novel theory of religion.</p><p>Critics may find some of Becula&apos;s sources dubious. His reply: ‘They had their problems, but also deep insights. The pont of higher education is to learn to distinguish wheat from chaff.’</p></div></body></html>
