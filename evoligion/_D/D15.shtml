Revelation has long been assumed to be the easiest approach, but the more reliable methods include:</p><ul><li><b>Instinct</b>. Rote knowledge encoded in DNA. Works for plants, earthworms &mdash; and humans in danger of drowning in cold water.</li><li><b>Mimesis</b>. Copy-cat learning. Works for kittens and children. </li><li><b>Inquiry</b>. Verbal transmission, both aural and visual. Works for humans, if — and only if — their sources are good.</li><li><b>Research</b>. Adult inquiry into unknown territory. This accounts for the most of the difference between life in sub-Saharan Africa and the so-called Dark Ages, and life in, for instance, Berkeley, Edinburgh, or the Cambridges.</li></ul><p class="flu">If these were sufficient, all our communities would be as pleasant, well informed, well governed, and <i>comfortable</i> as the 4 above. Among the reasons they are not is the abundance of choices produced by Inquiry and Research, the enthusiasm with which we pursue incomplete and untested ideas, and, indeed, the malign influence of revelation.</p><p>This chapter is an example of <b>critical analysis</b>, the missing step in choosing among competing interpretations of what we think we have learned. While it disparages an idea that has appealed to many people for 1400 years, it is not an unwarranted attack. Fundamentally, it takes advantage of a new insight — one that was not available until 1975 — to somewhat belatedly examine the result of a wildly mistaken identity. I undertook this analysis in an effort to understand the appeal of a particular strange idea-complex. Had the rise of Donald Trump occurred 20 years earlier, I might have chosen to analyze the ‘Christian’-Evangelical idea-complex, which is equally strange. Having grown up assuming that the Enlightenment ideology that permeated my academic family (and the Founding Fathers) was an American commonplace, I missed the significance of the preparatory work by Reagan and the Bushes.  Na&iuml;ve, that!</p><p>Be it understood that critical analysis of an idea is in no sense an attack upon the people who espouse it (despite their frequent claim to the contrary).

The task is challenging and doubly awkward, first because only a bowdlerized version of the TA is known to most Moslems, and then because it is hyperbolically unrelated to recoverable history.</p><p>The TA was created late in the day, when the Arab Conquest needed divine sanction to control restive but superstitious subjects who</p><blockquote>had been too long accustomed to looking upon their rulers as divine for them to be capable of taking up any other position</blockquote><p class=flu>&mdash; as <a class="fn">MacDonald<span>	MacDonald, DB (1903) <cite>Development of Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence and Constitutional Theory</cite> (Charles Scribner, NYC).</span></a> put it. As the dust settled and the vultures gorged, clerics sorted through a belated omnium-gatherum of nomad ritual, bicameral voices of desert prophets, falible memories, tales from the Torah, lectionaries of &lsquo;heretical&rsquo; Syrian Christians, military reminiscence, and the stories of <a class="fn"><i>hakawati</i><span>	Professional story tellers, who can still be found in Islamic cafés. Think flying carpets, peacock-tailed horses, and djinns in ancient bottles.</span></a> who imagined a history as it should have been, to cobble together the Quranic sanction. Oddly, non-Arab sources say little of the TA's Rashidun, the 4 ‘rightly guided’ caliphs, successors of Mohamet: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali (632–661 CE, 0–29 AH), who — according to the TA — were annihilating their armies and conquering their cities:Jerusalem and Damascus AH 14; Syria and Mesopotamia AH 17; Egypt AH 20; Persia AH 21; final redaction of the Quran AH 30.</p><p>In the following material, the different spellings of the prophet(s) of Islam in quotations are those of the authors. In the text, they represent different interpretations, or possibly different individuals. Clearly, Islam has a more complex and contradictory history than is commonly acknowledged. This history is belatedly being recovered by the same painstaking — and for many, painful — analysis that Christianity underwent during the Enlightenment, once again led largely by German researchers.</p><p>I reintroduce the term ‘Mohametan’ (a usage from the days of Mohamet), as a reminder that the Archangel Gabriel was a creation of Mohamet's bicameral mind, and that despite all supernaturalist claims, the revelations of ‘Allah’ were put into Gabriel's mouth by Mohamet's right (?) hemisphere reading his subconscious to him.

If some people are doing wrong things in Islam, that doesn't means Islam asks them to do wrong things. — This is a direct quote from an anonymous contemporary Muslim-3 picked off a passing web blog, and it is common currency among peaceful, warm-hearted, decent, caring, ignorant people.</p><p>‘Ignorant’, in this context, means being unaware of the seachange — if one can speak of such things in the desert — that occurred in the Syrian 8th century. Islam at its birth apparently shared the lovingkindness that characterized early Christianity &mdash; for the very good reason that it began as unitarian Christian congregations rejected by the newly orthodox Trinitarians after the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE.</p><p>Rock inscriptions, sacred sites, and coins from the Negev &mdash; which was all of Arabia in the days of Cyrus &mdash; show no trace of the pagan culture postulated by the Islamic  <i>jahiliyah</i> (pre-Mohametan days of polytheistic ignorance&rsquo;) nor of a 30-year flurry of monotheism-at-sword-point. Instead, they reveal a slowly developing monotheism in which the Semitic <i>m-h-m</i> root drifted over 3 centuries from being written as an adjective meaning valuable, to being read as a personal name.</p><p>The birth of Islam apparently had some of the features described by the Ahmadis, a sect so gentle and civilized that Pakistani law forbids them to call themselves Muslims. There is no evidence for the early attacks by 30,000 warriors and 10,000 horses (and never a mention of logistics or water). These numbers had to wait for the formation of slave armies. But as soon as Abu Bakr had battered the nomad tribes back into the fold (the Riddah campaigns), the Conquest moved out of Arabia. It soon needed the justification of divine instruction for its behavior (the &lsquo;wrong things&rsquo;), which the kerygma of the Quran was created to supply.</p><p>Today the Quran and the hadiths encourage Moslems to tell infidels things like the section epigraph as a form of <i>taqiyya</i> (lies for the sake of jihad) until such time as only Allah is worshipped, and said infidels have been converted or eliminated. <b>But it was not always so.</b> The Nestorian Patriarch Ishoyahb III (d. 659) wrote to the schismatic Metropolitan Shemʿon-of-Rev-Ardashir (without mentioning any Arab names):</p><blockquote>As for the <a class="fn">Hagarene<span>	In Genesis 16, Hagar, Egyptian concubine of Abraham, gives birth to Ishmael (16:12 And he shall be a wild man &hellip;), the progenitor of the Arabs.

Hagar and Ishmael are then sent off to live in the desert. </span></a>Arabs, to whom God has at this time given rule over the world, you know well how they act towards us.

This theological position is incompatible with glaring differences among the descriptions of the gods of the different sects. In psychological fact, we each create for ourselves a god whom we are content to worship. In linguistic fact, when poetic figures of speech meet obsessive-compulsive literalists, ‘unexpected results occur’, as computer programmers put it. The Christian Trinity is one of them, and the nature of Christ another. Characteristically, the major sectarian division is over undecidable questions; the ‘dimensionality’ of god and Jesus. Table 15.1 shows how these linguistic puzzles were resolved into major historical sects.</p><p>This is not a theological quibble. Divine dimensionality <i>matters</i>!

The number of such councils recognized as ‘ecumenical’ varies, with the Roman church recognizing 21 and some churches accepting only the first 2. The first 7, Nicea in 325 CE to Nicea II in 787 CE, were defining in the West until the 11th century: In effect, anything that reduced the power of the church hierarchy became heretical.

The Jews have collected 22% of the Nobel Prizes. Out of 835 individual laureates, 10, or 1.2%, were Muslims. If we accept the Prizes as an honest if sometimes fallible effort to define ‘those who benefit humanity’, YHVH's culture is then 22/1.2 = 18.3 times as <a class="fn">useful to the world<span>	This might be felt unfair because it does not correct for the high percentage of educated Jews working in Western universities, compared to the number of Muslims still living in tribal conditions. But many Jews lived in North Africa before moving to Israel, and the overall population comparison increases the imbalance. If intelligence, altruism and good luck (taken as the chief ingredients of Nobelicity) are uniformly distributed, the opportunity for a culture to win a Nobel is proportional to its share of the population. The 26% of the world that is Muslim, compared to the 0.2% that is Jewish, should then have collected 26/0.2 = 130 times as many Prizes as the Jews. This means that the average Jew is 18.3·130 = 2379 times as likely to win a Nobel as the average Muslim. With only 1 significant figure in one of the inputs, we round this to 2000. During Islam's Golden Age, Muslims and Jews were indistinguishable intellectually, and even today, Iranian  technicians are perfectly capable of manufacturing a nuclear bomb. It seems to me that a 2000-fold difference requires an explanation.</span></a> as Allah's.</p><p>If this utility difference cannot be attributed to Nature, Nurture is the usual suspect. One cannot blame the difference on Western gangster-capitalist oppression of the Arabs; they did, after all, create the first transcontinental empire (still largely in place, albeit politically fractured), destroying all they could of earlier religions, and sending home slaves by the ten-thousand from every conquered nation. The Jews, meanwhile, were scattered, and (however indispensible to their hosts) confined to quarters and culturally despised. The clearest psychoreligious difference between Jews and Moslem Arabs is that Moslems are told from birth that Allah's misbehavior is normative and <i>desirable</i>, while the Jews, from Abraham on, chose to housebreak YHVH, civilize him, and work individually to make the world a better place for all his creatures. (If this difference is currently clouded by the behavior of Israelis, it is at least partly because their neighbors keep trying to kill them. This will distract even the most dedicated graduate student.) The critical difference — as Rachels made clear — is that <b>we must evaluate a god's commands to us <i>before</i> we can decide whether he is good or not.</b> Islam, in the manner of a secret society, initially demanded acceptance of whatever its prophet might say in the future. This <a class="fn">‘secret-society’<span>	DS Margoulioth (1914) <cite>The Early Development of Mohammedanism</cite> (Williams and Norgate, London): 5.</span></a> approach was long carried on to the point that infidels were not allowed to touch the Quran, let alone <i>read</i> it (Suras 17:45, 18:57, 41:44, and 56:79). Like the secretly negotiated feudofascist Trans-Pacific Partnership, the idea is to get acceptance before revealing what is to be accepted, since no rational person outside the 1‰ would accept it after reading it.</p><p>Succinctly, the difference in godheads is once again a process of <a href="../_A/A04.shtml#T4.6">domestication</a>:</p><p style="margin: 6px auto; text-align: center;" class="rc">Abraham's god ∶ Isaiah's god ∷ jackal ∶ border collie.</p><p class="flu">Unfortunately, Islam regards such housebreaking as ‘corruption’, while the Christian version of the Old Testament includes only the barest record of this domestication, omitting the centuries of rabbinical debate and analysis recorded in the Jewish commentaries. This means that Abrahamic fundamentalists of all stripes — including a disproportionate fraction of the US Congress — continue to worship a primitive version of the Biblical god.</p><p>To be sure, Mohametans have devoted thousands of man-years to the study of the Quran in an attempt to make practical use of its ad hoc legal and social verbiage. This would be a reasonable endeavor <b>if the Quran were a better foundation</b>. After all, the dicta of Hamurabi, Moses, and Solon can still be found at the root of Western jurisprudence, so the ‘revealed’ legislation of one person is not necessarily a disadvantage. But the Quran is so incoherent and self-contradictory that it is necessary to assume that certain passages ‘abrogate’ others. What is left is so contaminated by the values of the alpha male that it is not suitable for post-Neolithic society.</p><p>Mohametan reformers have repeatedly tried to civilize Allah. The catch is that while the slow domestication of YHVH was a consensual community effort and recorded in scripture, Allah took note of this process and made sure that it <a class="fn">would not happen<span>	 Recall, in all of this, that Allah effectively shared Muhamad's bicameral brain, and so was cognizant of everything he knew.</span></a> to him. Even <a href="../_F/F23.shtml#39a">Mohammed Iqbal</a>, seeking peace between Moslems and Hindus in India, resisted critical analysis of Islam. All a Mohametan reformer can hope for is to write heretical fiction, with no response from ‘good’ Moslems except death threats. Keep this handicap in mind as we explore the Eirenic and Gaian aspects of Islam's claim to being a religion.</p><a class="tro"    href="#02" id="03">&#10835;&emsp;&emsp;</a><h3> <a href="#TOC"> A Fundamental Difference </a></h3><a class="tri"    href="#04">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a><p class="epi">Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached. — Manuel II Palailogos, Byzantine emperor, 1391 CE</p><p>Judaism and Islam may both be based on revelation, but there is a critical difference in their foundations. Recognizing that</p><blockquote>bicameral dicta are the automatic integration of ambient custom regarded as authoritative,</blockquote><p class="flu">the Israelites and Mohamet worked in very different milieus. The Israelites had a well established mythic basis that evolved only at a centennial pace, and a mind-set opposed to anything offered by other cultures — but also a corrective tradition of rational analysis of their beliefs. Mohamet had a ferment of nomad tribal rules, Arabic animism, remnants of various Mesopotamian pantheons, conventional Judaism, Byzantine (Nicene) Christianity, any number of Judaeo-Christian heresies, and a mind-set steeped in supernaturalism and impressed by the existence of doctrinal texts available to other cultures. Later, when his ongoing revelation had been accepted by his followers (on the basis of superstition rather than rationality or ethics) his subconscious used the process to further its own Instinct-1 agenda (conceptually, sex, power, and money; specifically women, slaves and loot).</p><p>We are constantly reminded that we must not judge Mohamet by current standards. He was a man of his times, and many desert nomads did not find his behavior reprehensible. This is fair <i>as long as the standard of comparison is the 7th-century Bedouin of Arabia</i>. Indeed, there are hadiths suggesting that Mohamet actually improved the couth of outlying tribes (‘Do not urinate in the corner of the mosque.’ At-Tirmidhi 147).</p><p>However, once Mohamet's ideas come in contact with the wider world, they can be judged against the standards of the Axial Age, a millennium earlier. They do not fare well. The Axials included philosophers who were conscious and introspective, as well as religions of less superstition and greater tolerance. If we should not compare Mohamet to William the Silent, Hume, Spinoza, the Dali Lama, Wittgenstein, or Pope Francis, we are certainly allowed to compare him to Akhnaton, Socrates, Isaiah, Zoroaster, Gautama, and Confucius.</p><p>Of the Axials, only Zoroaster was primarily bicameral (but like Hammurabi, his bicameral adviser was exceptionally talented). None of the Axials were nomad raiders; none led dawn raids on sleeping villages, nor asked for 20% of the loot, nor the best of the women, nor felt that he needed to have competitors assassinated. None of them were accused of self-serving revelations, in the manner of Aisha's wry ‘It seems to me your [Mohamet's] Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!’ when Gabriel revealed that it was written on the tablet in Paradise that Mohamet could have ‘any believing woman’ he fancied (slaves and infidels were always up for grabs). (An introspective prophet might have become suspicious when he noticed how frequently his god pimped for him.)</p><p>The Axial systems all guided civilizations that continue tocontribute to human welfare. If they have supernatural aspects, they are the sort you could take home to meet your parents. Nearly all Mohametans I have talked to agree that one should not worship a god whose behavior one could not endorse. Yet they thought it not unreasonable that I should accept Allah. I was confused by this until I learned by casual questions that none of them had read Mohamet's biography. All assumed that a question about Allah's attitude toward slavery referred to the philosophical question of submitting to the will of god, deemed a beneficial step, just as it is in Christianity. In short, they knew nothing about the &lsquo;actual&rsquo; behavior of their prophet or their god (as written to endear them to 7th-century raiders). Mohametans take the success of the Arab Conquest as verification of the truth of Mohamet's kerygma, so that if  Mohamet did it or Allah commanded it, it <i>defines</i> good, requiring a complete rejection of moral autonomy on the part of the believer and the abnegation of critical thinking and conscious introspection. The whole of Islam is contained in the command of mindlessness: ‘Submit!’</p><a class="tro" href="#03" id="04">&#10835;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a class="tro" href="#00"> &#9651;&emsp;&emsp;</a><h2><a href="#TOC"> THE STRUCTURE OF ISLAM</a></h2><a class="tri" href="#05">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a class="tri" href="#10"> &#9661;&emsp;&emsp;</a><p class="epi">[R]adical evils flow from the faith in all ages and in every country, and must continue to flow so long as the Kor'an is the standard of Belief.

Islam defines itself by rituals. (Curiously, the last 4 were established by Muhamad's ancestor Qusayy 5 generations earlier):<ol id="04a"><li><i>Shahada</i>: repeat ‘There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet’ before the wrong people, and you are trapped in a cult that you cannot leave under pain of death.</li><li><i>Salat</i>: ritual prayer <a class="fn">5 times a day.<span>	Recall Allah's initial request for 50 prayers a day. ‘It is an absurdity to believe that God has human passions, and indeed one of the lowest of them, namely a restless appetite for applause.’ — David Hume.</span></a></li><li><i>Zakat</i>: giving 2.5% of one's savings to the poor.</li><li><i>Sawm</i>: fasting and self-control during the holy month of Ramadan.</li><li><i>Hajj</i>: pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if one is able.</li></ol><li><b>The Quran</b>, believed to be an exact and immutable copy of a ‘preserved tablet’ in Paradise, revealed to Muhamad piecemeal by Archangel Gabriel over 2 decades.</li><li><b>The Traditional Account</b>. See <a href="#11">below</a>.</li><li><b>Hadiths</b>, short records of what Muhamad said, attested by <i>isnads</i>, or chains of transmitters of hearsay. Their importance is that the prophet was assumed to be guided by Allah at all times, so anything he said or did had the <a class="fn">force of divinity<span> The one exception seems to be the time he ignorantly forbade the pollination of a date orchard, thereby eliminating the year's crop. He admitted that this was his mistake, not Gabriel's. (Unpollinated dates are small, woody, and low on sugar.) On the other hand, most of his ‘god-given’ ordinances had to be ‘reinterpreted’ once the Arab Conquest reached the more complex world outside the nomad's desert.</span></a> behind it and was a clear guide to righteous (ie, prescribed) <a class="fn">behavior.<span>	At this point I envisioned a table of the hadith collectors, their dates, the number they had collected, and the number they accepted, but the available data left it sorely incomplete. The Sunni collectors worked 2 centuries after Muhamad, spent much of their working life collecting hadiths, reported up to 700,000 collected, and (not counting duplicates) accepted less than 1% as authentic. Imam Malik (93–179 AH) was the earliest collector; Bukhari (184–256 AH) is regarded as the most reliable. Strong intuition suggests that if 99% of what one collects is discarded as rubbish, one should not put too much faith in the remaining 1%, <i>especially</i> if it tells him what he wants to hear. (I have asked statisticians about this question. Unfortunately, their discipline offers no help, but they concur with my intuition.)</span></a> Hadith are essential to obsessive-compulsives who need to know, e.g., what to do with their hands when they pray, because the Quran is silent on such vital matters.</li><li><b>Madhabs</b>, schools of Islamic law, that teach the rules — otherwise codified as shari'a law — reputedly canonized by the generation that knew Muhamad. Rules include the ritual purity or impurity (depending on which <i>madhab</i> is asked) of dog saliva, the rules of marriage between humans and <a class="fn">djinns,<span>	The French spelling, but the one I learned from <cite>1001 Nights</cite>, for the smoky creatures that appeared when you opened long-sealed bottles or polished old oil lamps. They weren't very bright, but could grant wishes. Muhamad thought there were [only] 3 kinds: ‘One type with wings, that fly in the air; one type that are snakes and scorpions; and another that settles and moves [?]’. [A 4th — and probably original — variety is the small desert whirlwind known as a ‘dust devil’ in the US southwest. One-half to (rarely) 10 meters in diameter, they will sandblast anyone who walks into them.] Baly reports from personal experience that ‘unbelieving Jinn do not feel comfortable with pleasant scents and perfumes, especially the scent of musk; whereas Muslim Jinn love it just as Muslim humans do’.<br>--------------------<br>	WA Baly (2005) <cite>How to Protect Yourself From Jinn &amp; Shaitan</cite> (Al-Firdous Ltd, London): 19.</span></a> and all other aspects of life.</li><li><b>The ulema</b>, respected teachers who interpret the rules without introducing <i>bida</i>, or innovations (cf Jewish rabbis). They can issue rulings, or <i>fatwas</i>,which are binding on all Mohametans, including orders to killnon-believers for ‘insulting’ Islam. In 2012, Dr Abdullah Badr, a professor of Islamic exegesis at Al Azhar University (Cairo) <a href="http://meforum.org/3387/militant-muslims-cutting-out-tongues">announced</a> on TV that ‘any dog who mocks the Sharia, or mocks Islam, or blames it, we will cut his tongue out’, this being acceptable because any poet who mocked Allah's Messenger was assassinated. Muhamad is not on record as possessing anything resembling a sense of humor; evidently this is also forbidden to any sincere follower.</li><li><b>Al Azhar University</b> in Cairo, commonly described as the most prestigious Islamic university. Sheikh Muhammad <a href="http://www.meforum.org/blog/2015/11/isis-byproduct">Abdullah Nasr</a>, a graduate of Al Azhar in Islamic law, explains why Al Azhar cannot condemn the things that Westerners object to about Muhamadans:<blockquote>It can't [condemn the Islamic State as un-Islamic]. The Islamic State is a byproduct of Al Azhar's programs. So can Al Azhar denounce itself as un-Islamic? Al Azhar says there must be a caliphate and that it is an obligation for the Muslim world [to establish it]. Al Azhar teaches the law of apostasy and killing the apostate. Al Azhar is hostile towards religious minorities, and teaches things like not building churches, etc. Al Azhar upholds the institution of jizya [extracting tribute from religious minorities]. Al Azhar teaches stoning people. So can Al Azhar denounce itself as un-Islamic?</blockquote></li><li><b>Shari’a</b>. Because Allah's rules did not work once the Arabs left the desert, ways had to be found to cope with new situations, again without <i>bida</i>. The ideal is that shari'a should divide all behavior into categories of: Forbidden (<i>haram</i>); Disliked (<i>makruh</i>); Permitted (<i>ja'iz</i> or <i>mubah</i>);  Recommended (<i>mandub</i> or <i>mustahabb</i>) e.g., clitoridectomy; and Obligatory (<i>fard</i> or <i>wajib</i>; so that one always knows — just as in bicameral days — exactly what Allah wants him to do. ‘All’ means <i>all</i>; there is in theory no free will. Lacking the option of rational legislation, 4 approaches are used instead:<ul><li><b>The Quran</b>, understood&nbsp;as the unalterable word of a god.</li><li><b>Sunna</b>, ‘habitual practice’ or ‘trodden path’ — hence the importance of anything that Muhamad's did or said. </li><li><b>Ijma</b>, geriatric consensus, and </li><li><b>Qiyas</b>, reasoning by analogy, are the last resorts, and as close as Islam can get to the Western ideal of rational debate and democratic choice, but the consensus and the reasoning are constrained to consistency with everything Muhamad laid down. </li></ul></ul><p>Shari’a and English law are at matrimonial odds, with England's first female Shari'a judge <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/02/uks-first-female-sharia-judge-we-cant-ask-muslims-not-to-have-more-than-one-wife/">claiming</a> ‘government cannot ask Muslims not to have more than one wife’. Of course it can, if the Muslims want to live in England.

Muhamad was satisfied with a religion for Arabs. Later non-Arab caliphs justified their coups with the idea that Islam was for the world, and should be imposed by force.

He must be killed.’ Killing non-believers represents 1400 years of selection for pothodoxy, which as these examples show, turns smoothly into mental illness.</p><p>In 1981, Moslem countries playing the oil card forced the UN to remove the implicit right to change religions from Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.

Young human brains are primed to acquire language, but there is much to be learned about the process, and I can support my suggestion only by anecdote.</p><p>My own language acquisition was (after a week of alphabet teaching by my mother) free-form and self-directed, mostly wandering barefoot through Webster’s 2nd International Dictionary. Any search for a particular word would find me ambushed by interesting words noticed en route and the new words and new ideas they led to &mdash; and what was I looking for when I started? The approach is consistent with the philosophical expectation that finding answers to questions &mdash; the scientist&apos;s occupation/hobby &mdash; is fun, and with my career as a research scientist. The question is about cause and effect. Suppose, in those early days (age 3) that I had had to devote my energy to chanting formulas, with attention to pronunciation, pitch, intonation and rhythm, and cultural immersion in the understanding that these formulas held the answers to all of life’s questions. If I could later develop a philosophical outlook, what might it be?</p><p>I submit that early ritual chanting is a mechanism that implants memes so deeply that they become a normative aspect of personality. This might explain the Mohametan’s overreaction to ridicule of Mohammed or the Quran: he has so internalized these cultural memes that he cannot avoid taking ridicule personally. Similarly, the memes provide automatic answers to so many of life’s questions (ideally, to <i>all</i> of them), that he is unprepared for, and resistant to, the idea of thinking for himself. Others who lack the formulaic memes will be seen as inferior and soulless until they acquire them.</p><p>A possibly related process, showing the maleability of the developing brain closer to home, is the relation between TV watching and attention-deficit disorder in the US.

Yet there is hope: Tunisia outlawed takfir in 2011 in what appears to be the most progressive step the Islamic world has taken in a millennium.</p><a class="tro" href="#10.6" id="10.8">&#10835;&emsp;&emsp;</a><h4> <a href="#TOC"> <i>Offensive Jihad</i> </a></h4><a class="tri" href="#11">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a><p class="epi">The duties of the Imam &hellip;<br> 6.

He recalls the Penitents of Kufa, who to atone for the death of Husain (Muhamad's grandson), and understanding the ‘<b>value of bloodshed as opening the gates of Paradise</b> &hellip; desire[d &hellip;] far more to lose their own lives in the pursuit of their aim than to compass that aim’.</p><p>Considering the <a href="#16">weaknesses</a> of the Traditional Account, the Penitents and the epigraph reveal an extraordinary and unwarranted arrogance. This is what the West is facing, and not doing a very good job of recognizing.

We have a million disaffected Mohametans seeking something better than the in-house warfare that has characterized Islam since its birth — and what do we do? Send them back to Turkey, whose government is trying its inept best to reconstitute the Ottoman Empire! This is not a good use of our opportunity.</p><p>The parental generation may be incapable of change, and will seek to pass their problems on to their children. Young strays and orphans, however, are prime targets for reconditioning. We should offer them the best that we can: comfort, welcome, medical care, foster homes, schooling, continuity, Enlightenment ideology — and by the time they are out of grad school we have 10,000 Arab-speaking, Western  educated agnostics who still understand how to deal with the Islamic mind-set, and it has cost us maybe a gigadollar. I should think something useful might be done along these lines.</p><p>If we botch this opportunity, we face a continuation of Muhamad's instructions to get rid of unbelievers by whatever means.

It is supported by an immense bibliography in a score of languages, leading Ernst Renan to imagine that Islam was ‘born in the clear light of history’, an opinion often quoted on Islamic web pages. For the flavor of this ‘history’ in its least hagiographic form, Edwardes's short <cite>Life of Mohammad</cite> {E} is recommended.</p><p>While this section will primarily follow Watt (1961), whofiltered out much of the obvious supernaturalism, we begin with Edwardes's summary of what is told of the first 40 years of Mohammad's life:</p><blockquote>Mohamed was born in Mecca around AD 570 into a poor family of the Quraysh tribe. When he was twenty-five years of age he was employed by Khadija, a wealthy widow, to go with her on one of her trading caravans to Syria. On the successful completion of the journey, Mohammed married Khadija, who was some fifteen years older than he. Two sons and four daughters were born of this marriage. The two boys died in infancy, but one of the daughters, Fatima, married Mohamet's cousin Ali, and it is the descendants of Fatima and Ali who are said to be the true heirs of the prophet. — {E:5} [These descendants bear some version of the name <i>Sa&iuml;d</i> today.]</blockquote><p>The great powers of the day were Christian Byzantium and Magian (Zoroastrian) Persia. Arabia lay between them, exposed to intrigue and armies. Mecca was described as a crossroads of trade and an entrepôt for caravans.</p><p>[Mohamet long wondered why god had sent prophets to Jews and Christians, but never to the Arabs.] In 610 CE, <a class="fn">when he was 40<span>	40 is perhaps to be construed, as in Jewish mysticism, as a time of preparation, like the Israelites&apos; 40 years in the Sinai, and Jesus&apos;s 40 days in the wilderness.</span></a> and meditating in a cave on Mount Hira, he saw visions and heard <a class="fn">Gabriel<span>	Gabriel is often described as the only female archangel. This was not mentioned by Muhamad, because the innate misogyny of Arab culture would reject any message so delivered.<br> &lsquo;Women are like cows, horses, and camels, for all are ridden&rsquo;, explains a standard commentary on the Quran, the <cite>Tafsir al-Qurtubi</cite> <b>17</b>: 172, and the sexual connotation applies to to all.</span></a> [or a djinn] delivering the [long-awaited] prophetic message for the Arabs. His original concept of god was strictly monotheistic, but <i>al-Lah</i> was just ‘the abstract god’. [Al-Lat — the feminine version of al-Lah — was a moon-goddess idol; stones marked with a crescent moon were ultimately identified as Allah, whoever they might have been originally.]</p><p id="03a">Watt identifies 5 themes in Mohamet's early revelations, and notes that ‘had he known that these were <a class="fn">his own ideas,<span>	They do not immediately strike the modern reader as ‘Mohammad's own ideas’. They were, it seems, ideas that he picked up from anti-Trinitarian Christians (who morphed into the first Muslims). The themes attributable to Mohammad and his vocation tend to be more along the lines of: <br>	• <b>Obey me</b> because I am the final messenger of a one-component god.<br>	• <b>Carrot:</b> Believe me and you get lots of posthumous sex.<br>	• <b>Stick:</b> Believe me or burn in hell for eternity.<br>	• <b>Message:</b> Kill the infidels.<br></span></a> the whole basis would have been cut away from his religious movement’:</p><ol><li>God's goodness and power.</li><li>The return to God for judgement.</li><li>Man's response: gratitude and worship.</li><li>Man's response to God: generosity.</li><li>Mohamet's own vocation.</li></ol><blockquote>The core from which Islam emerged was the conflict between the Meccans' nomadic attitudes and the new materialistic culture of trade.{49} The malaise arose from the unscrupulous pursuit of wealth [on the part of the rich merchants], and the Qur'an tries to curb this.{53}</blockquote><p>When the traders complained that his preaching was cutting into profits, and threatened him, Mohammed temporized, avoiding conflict by deciding that the idols of near-by shrines (a source of profit) were daughters of al-Lah and acceptable intercessors. But this conflicted with his monotheism. His god became Allah, and the daughters soon reverted to powerless rocks. The revelation that had permitted them to be worshipped as intermediaries became the so-called ‘Satanic Verses’, [revealed in the usual manner, indicating that Mohammed could not distinguish Gabriel from Satan. This remains an unresolved and very sore point with Mohametan clerics.]</p><p>By 615, Meccan resistance to Mohammad's preaching drove many of his followers across the Red Sea to Abyssinia. The details are unclear; some remained until 628; others returned sooner. [After Islam became the state religion, people clamored for mention in its scriptures, and contradictory lists of who was with Mohammed at what point were created.]</p><p>Khadija, 65, died about 620, when Mohammed was 50. [This may have unsettled him, because he was known as uxorious. Perhaps Khadija was as much parental substitute as wife.	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="New-idea"></a>He said of her, ‘She believed in me when none else would believe. In the whole world I had but one friend, and she was that!’.] His uncle and protector Abu Talib also died at this time, increasing the pressure against him which ultimately forced him from Mecca.</p><p>Medina, 250 miles north, [was a crowded oasis with 11 clans, 3 Jewish and 8 Arab,] with deteriorating relations between the groups. Under <i>lex talionis</i>, a murder can lead to a perpetual feud. The solution is a neutral arbitrator. In a shame culture,</p><blockquote>If someone shames another tribe, tribal warfare could result, and often only the skilful intervention of a third party ends the strife. Arab lore is full of stories of how wise and skillful men have intervened in difficult situations. In fact, many national rulers gain their fame and reputation from their skills at ending tribal strife. — <a href="http://nabataea.net/h%26s.html">Roland Muller</a></blockquote><p class="flu">so the Medinans invited Mohammed (and followers) to move to Medina and arbitrate their disputes.</p><p>In 622, some 70 believers left Mecca for Medina, with Mohamet and his lieutenant Abu-Bakr soon following. This was the Hijrah, or Emigration, and the starting date of the Mohametan calendar [1 AH, but conversion of later dates between Western (solar) and Islamic (mostly lunar) calendars is complex]. Mohamet was Chief of the ‘clan’ of Emigrants, Prophet of the new religion, and generally a Big Man by anthropological classification. Hoping for acceptance by the Jews, he adopted some of their customs (fast days, praying toward Jerusalem). When his revelations disagreed with the Old Testament, the Jews rejected his claims to prophethood [and he became the <a class="fn">prototypical judaeophobe].<span>	The morning after the murder of Ashraf [at Muhamad's request], the Prophet declared, ‘Kill any Jew who falls under your power’. — Tabari 7:97</span></a> Nevertheless, his experience with the Meccan shift from nomads to merchants helped him guide Medina's similar transition.</p><p>In 623 Aisha, age 6, became Mohamet chief wife. (They dd not consummate the marriage for 3 years.) The other principal event of the year was the initiation of <i>jihad</i>, ‘holy war’, in the form of raids upon Meccan caravans. (How else were the Emigrants to make a living? asks Watt. ‘It was a kind of sport rather than war’ {107}). In quoting the Quran, Watt translates <i>jihad</i> as ‘striving’, in the Sufic sense of fighting one's own inner demons. In Islam's first successful raid {E:94} (which established the pattern of its future behavior), 8 Muhamadans captured a Meccan caravan by attacking 4 men as they were preparing dinner during a sacred no-warfare month. Muhamad initially rebuked the raiders for this breach of tradition and refused his portion of the booty. [His subconscious clearly found this unsatisfactory,] and revealed to him Sura 2:217: ‘Fighting [during the sacred months] is a sacrilege, but disbelief in Allah is a greater sacrilege’, so it's permissible to attack infidels at any time.</p><p>[Ibn Ishaq tells us of a caravan that carried frankincense, silk, precious metals, and leather {E:92}. Then, in his characteristic manner of leaving contradictions to be resolved by others, he notes that the raiders came home with raisins and uncured hides {E:94}, the cargo of the winter Yemen-Palestine caravan, never commenting on this discrepancy. Raisins and hides once a year will not have made anyone rich.]</p><p>When the Jews dismissed his contention that his religion was continuous with Judaism and Christianity, his response was to claim corruption of the Torah and Gospel (‘It need not be supposed that Mohamet thought this out logically’, says Watt dryly {115}.) He also changed the <i>qibla</i> (the direction faced during prayer) from Jerusalem to Mecca, and asserted that Abraham [who left no contradictory record of his beliefs] was the founder of <i>hanifiya</i>, or true religion.</p><p>624 brought the battle at Badr, in which 300 Mohametans defeated what had started out as 1000 Meccans protecting a caravan. The psychological consequence was that Mohamet's god was perceived as strong and worth worshipping. <a class="fn">Wellhausen,<span>	J Wellhausen (1927) <cite>The Arab Kingdom and its Fall </cite> (tr. MJ Weir)(Univ. Calcutta): 16.</span></a> who up to this point has been courteously respectful, says bluntly:</p><blockquote>[The victory at Badr] had a very great moral effect. &hellip; Islam now no longer remained tolerant, but acted like a reign of terror in Medina. &hellip; Under flimsy pretexts, he drove out, and in a few years annihilated, the whole of the communities of Jews in the oases of Medina.</blockquote><p>[As described by Lawrence of Arabia 13 centuries later, the promise of loot was a powerful recruiting policy, and Mohamet shared the loot.] After Badr Mohamet was strong enough to drive the Jews out of Medina. [In the next 5 years he led <a class="fn">27 dawn attacks <span>	Abu Muhamad bin al-Tabari (870–920) <cite>History of al-Tabari</cite>. 9(?) vols. (State University of NY, Albany): IX-115.</span></a> on sleeping villages, and directed another 47. The revealed rules of engagement were: Kill the men; bring the loot and women to Mohammed. He would take 20% of the loot and the best of the women, and distribute the rest.]</p><p>At this point the story changes to one of battles fought and Jews expelled or slaughtered, the conquest of Mecca, and accession of nomad tribes. By 630 there are <a class="fn">preposterous<span>	No mention is made of the extreme logistic problems of protracted desert warfare when food, forage, and water are not easy to come by.

[Uh, women? Buddhists? Jains? Parsis? Christians?]</p><p>The preceding section is an abbreviated but fair resumé of the TA, and Mohammed has come out of it like a prophet and statesman. Watt's encomium has been accepted by Mohametans and also the rank and file of Western Islamic Studies — where the epigraph's bracketed questions are never asked.</p><p>The problem is that Watt (like the author) was a professor and product of the Enlightenment. Except when dealing with visceral intradepartmental rivalries, we tend to be courteous and sometimes clubbable. Like everyone, we think of ourselves as <i>defining the norm</i> — in a subculture characterized by job security, adequate income, IQs above 130, competence, rationality, open-mindedness, and critical analysis. This is a pleasant society — but not, perhaps, the most accurate basis for extrapolating world history.</p><p>When Watt came across something in Mohammed that didn't fit our society, he didn't see it. He did not consciously  whitewash, but he made excuses and civilized interpretations. Like Ibn Hisham bowdlerizing Ibn Ishaq's biography, he omitted anything undesirable. Unfortunately, this sanitized TA is not a realistic view of Islam.</p><p>If we ask for non-Islamic evidence supporting the TA, there is <i>none</i>. The evidence <i>against</i> it is remote, obscure, and specialized — but damning. If this upsets Moslems, it can't be helped. Only a rejection of critical thinking has kept them from discovering this for themselves.</p><p>Before presenting what we might call the Revised Account, let me set out my particular bias about Islam.</p><a class="tro" href="#12" id="13">&#10835;&emsp;&emsp;</a><h3> <a href="#TOC"> Bias, Again </a></h3><a class="tri" href="#14">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a><p class="epi">While I prefer Jesus's universalism to Mohammad's kill-the-infidel, I do not criticize Islam out of Christian fervor. Here is a description of Christianity (by a fictional Thai Buddhist) that is hard to argue with:</p><blockquote>[Christianity] is an insane collection of primitive magic and mumbo-jumbo, with cadavers resurrecting and walking around with holes in them, lepers suddenly healing and the blind suddenly seeing, virgins giving birth and snakes that talk. Since it's all a blatant lie, something has to be done to keep the faithful dropping coins onto the plate, or the economic model on which the whole pious edifice is based will collapse in less than a generation. It needs miracle machines. Lourdes is the most important. Of course, since there are no miracles, you have to have a large collection of people willing to lie to themselves. — <a class="fn">	J Burdett (2012)<span><cite>Vulture Peak</cite> (Vintage, NYC).<br>I thank Dr Marty McClure for calling this passage to my attention.</span></a></blockquote><p>The Moslem rank and file knows nothing but the Traditional Account, and as a result of indoctrination at an early age, are probably neurologically incapable of contemplating data that conflict with prior beliefs (a defining characteristic of conservatives). Their brain wiring simply does not provide for this eventuality. Given that belief in the TA is the solitary object of Islamic pedagogy; that educational techniques have been refined over the centuries; and that there is a death penalty for disbelief, it is hardly surprising that belief tends to be literal and fervent. As a result, ordinary Moslems will be offended by anything that challenges the Traditional Account, since it goes against everything they have been taught, and as a result of their school years, they have no way of responding except by incensed and sometimes violent denial.</p><p>Liberals are supposed to be able to understand the methodology and necessity of critical analysis. This ability has not been much in evidence with respect to Islam — but one has to try.

Had his work (ca 750) been known in the West we would have avoided a century of confusion about phlogiston a millennium later (1667–1778).</p><p>My favorable childhood impression of Mohammed was reinforced by the story that he cut off the sleeve of his prayer robe rather than disturb his sleeping cat Mu’izza. (The story as I met it is confusing because the tabbies&apos; forehead mark that commemorates this kindness is a Roman <b>M</b>, not an <a class="fn">Arabic meem<span>	Nomad clothing does not have the sort of sleeves described here. My confusion increased when Heinlein told of the ‘<i>mandarin</i> who cut off a priceless embroidered sleeve because a kitten was sleeping on it’. The Christian explanation of the M is that baby Jesus was fretful one day and could not sleep. Mary asked all the animals if they could help, but only a tabby kitten knew what to do. It jumped into Jesus's crib and purred him to sleep. For this, Mary allows tabbies to wear the M on their foreheads.<br>---------------------<br>	RA Heinlein (1957) <cite>The Door into Summer</cite> (Doubleday, NYC).

Our accetance of slavery may be the place to start, not simply on ethical grounds, but because it led to the Civil War, the consequent enrichment of corporations, and a perpetual resentment of the Federal government. Feudofascism tripped over its own greed in 1929. By 1936, Herbert Pell, a Harvard classmate whom FDR later appointed as US representative to the UN War Crimes Commission, could tell FDR that ‘his administration [ie, the New Deal] has made possible the continuance of American institutions for at least 50 years’ — that is, until the sharp break in the rising line of Fig. 23.1 in the mid '80s.

I find myself constantly embarrassed and apologetic when talking with foreigners about America's recent behavior, domestic and international.</p><p>The critical difference is that my ideal America is historically demonstrable. The Founding Fathers understood the slow growth of Enlightenment, <i>contributed to it</i>, and tried to design a government that could live up to their ideals despite Instinct-1 and purblind politicians — while providing a way to improve it at need. It worked reasonably well for 200 years. Try as I may, I cannot find anything remotely like the idealism of moderate Mohametans at the core of Islam (although the Quran's social-justice theme, however imaginary in origin and practice, is better stated than Christianity's version). But if I knew nothing except Ibn Ishaq's <cite>Life of Mohammed</cite>, I would regard Islam-1 as an implementation of the worst that Instinct-1 has to offer.

For a small fraction of what Islamic states have spent on weapons and ill-planned exhibitionism (Qatar comes to mind), any Mohametans unhappy in Cis-Jordan could have been resettled in modern, functioning cities, gainfully employed and getting on with their lives.

On internal evidence, both sorts of tales suffered from a century of oral transmission in a preliterate milieu where storytellers were rewarded for embellishment.</p><p>Anyone who knows <cite>The 1001 Nights</cite> understands the magic of Arab storytelling. Writing came late to the Arabs, with the earliest Arab text in 512 CE. Nomads had little use for books, but a reputation for good memories for oral literature. Much is made of this ability, but material is best learned in early childhood, when synapse modification is fast and furious. (‘You can't teach an old dog new tricks.’) Experiment shows that bards tell their story slightly differently each time, influenced by current events and audience feedback. Even though Islam regards detectable innovation with extreme prejudice, a skilled bard can retell a known story with acceptable embellishments. The tales told around desert campfires (then and now) require their heroes to be larger than life.</p><p>The root source, Ibn Ishaq's biography of Mohamet, the <cite>Sirat Rasul Allah (The Life of the Prophet of Allah)</cite> is basically a ragbag of unconnected, episodic <b>hadiths</b> strung together to create a possible coherent sequence of events.

At the very best, then, we have a  biography based upon oral history — the reminiscence of events of 80 years ago.</p><p>Like most people, I tend to trust my memory. But comparing notes on shared events of 70 years ago with friends, I find that we sometimes remember startlingly different versions, to the extent that if their version were true, my life would have been dramatically different. Since it is not, I perforce conclude that their version has been modified by frequent review and wishful thinking, while my version may have been modified by neglect and loss of detail. The more important a memory, and the oftener recollected, the more chance there is of ancillary thoughts — ‘What if such-and-such had happened at that point?’ — to mix with recollection. (Whatever else thoughts may be, they are at some point electrical impulses along axons and physicochemical reactions at synapses. Both processes may be delicate enough to be susceptible to classical communication cross-talk or maybe even quantum entanglement, so there are possible mechanistic approaches to studying memory modification.)</p><p>The major problem with Islamic ‘science’ is how knowledge is verified. This is the discipline of <b>epistemology</b>, or investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion, and the Western approach is very different from isnad-ranking. For questions of history, critical analysis collects all versions of an event, discards the impossible and anachronistic, tries to account for editorial bias and political embellishment, and seeks a consensus considering context and personalities. Sometimes, with luck, one can frame a hypothesis which can be falsified, thus allowing an erroneous consensus to be discarded.</p><p>Unfortunately, the first 2 centuries of Islamic tales lack the upporting data that one expects from witnesses of momentous events. Numismatic and inscriptional evidence — where they can be studied — tell a quieter and more plausible story, as does internal evidence in the Quran.</p><p>Some of the keenest minds in Islamology have sought to explain away problems with the TA. But because they had neither bicamerality nor recent research to build on, their discussions, however ingenious, are wide of the mark. As my first (and best) chemistry professor, Ambrose R.

Anachronistically, 5 generations before Mohammed, he established the 5 Pillars of Islam. Muhamad continued these, but since the <i>hajj</i> did not benefit him during his warlord days in Medina, until he conquered Mecca his versionof the 5th Pillar read ‘Pay [to Mohammed] one fifth of the booty taken in Allah's Cause’ {Bukhari: 1:2:50}.

Unlike most of the books cited in this chapter, which are impeccably academic, Winn's is a passionate and vernacular polemic which takes the New Testament as literally as many Moslems take the Quran. While this may occasionally distract from Winn's scholarship, it does not detract from it. Moslem critics chide him for taking passages ‘out of context’ — but a major problem of Islamic studies is the total <i>absence of context in the source material</i>. The Quran, hadith, and sunna are anachronic and episodic; the biography and history are heroic attempts to convert them into a a sequential story after a century or 2 of political creativity and differential folk processing of the episodes. Winn's book is valuable because his passages from the Quran are cross-referenced to ‘the Sunnah as recorded by Bukhari, Muslim, Ishaq, and Tabari — Islam’s earliest and more trusted sources’. He does a better job of reconstructing a chronology of Islamic events than Moslems do, because he points out the difficulties as he comes to them. (However, he takes no account of modern academic research that shines a new and totally different light on Islamic history, even to the limited extent that this is possible. In 25 years I have not found a single Moslem writer who applies critical analysis to Winn's topic; all commentary assumes (as noted by Manzoor above) that the Quran is the immutable word of an acceptable god and only needs to be interpreted properly.</p><p>The tales grow with time. <a class="fn">Uri Rubin<span>	(2000) ‘The Life of Muhammed and the Muslim Self-Image’ in	H.

The evidence offered for the subjective nature of Muhamad's revelation comes from a respected modern translator who was trying to prove its divine nature:</p><blockquote>Other people saw the Holy Prophet's lips move when he received the revelation, which shows that his reception of the revelation was not subjective but a real and external experience. — <a class="fn">	Maulana Muhammad Ali (1944)<span> <cite>A Manual of Hadith</cite> (Curzon, London): p11 n18.</span></a></blockquote><p class="flu">As we saw <a href="../_A/A03.shtml#18">earlier</a>, <i>this interpretation is exactly backwards</i>. The prophet's lips are moving because he is subvocalizing. Maulana's naïvely offered evidence tells us immediately that the revelation was subjective and <i>not</i> a real and external experience. (For what it is worth, Muhamad scored high on both known preconditions of schizophrenia: cultural acceptance of supernaturalism, and suggestibility.)</p><p>Long after bicamerality had faded in neighboring cultures, Muhamad had at least one bicameral experience as a child {E:25}.

The least we should expect from our god is consistency. The historical increase in ethical content of religion is achieved either by a series of divine revelations, or by the patient work of philosophers and teachers dragging a recalcitrant culture upward. If the first, <i>any</i> revelation after Jesus would be expected to emphasize those aspects of his kerygma that were novel and an ethical advance upon the Axial thinkers: there is no lack of opportunity here! While there are admonitions in the Quran that resemble (and probably are) Christian homiletics, there is nothing of the ‘love thy neighbor’ and ‘do good to them that hate you‘ that distinguish Jesus. There is only a 2-millennium regression to the unhousebroken YHVH of Abraham. Are we to understand that god is not logical?</p><p>Goldziher's dismissive epigraph above is only true about ethics. In practical matters, the Bedouin tradition ran: ‘I fight with my brothers, my brothers and I fight our cousins, we and our cousins fight the tribe, our tribe fights everybody.’ The unique aspect of Muhamad's ‘revealed’ contribution to the world was a 5th layer for the Bedouintradition: ‘and everybody fights <b>and loots</b> <a class="fn">the infidels’.<span>	This is the process Crone describes as: ‘Mohammed was neither a social reformer nor a resolver of spiritual doubts: he was the creator of a people’.<br>-------------------<br>	P Crone (1987) <cite>Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam</cite> (Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ): 237.</span></a></p><a class="tro" href="#20" id="21">&#10835;&emsp;&emsp;</a><h3> <a href="#TOC"> 5. <s>New Religion</s> </a></h3><a class="tri" href="#22">&#10836;&emsp;&emsp;</a><p class="epi">It is very difficult to explain why the monks and bishops of this time &hellip; should have &hellip; [passionately debated] ‘internal’ Christian &hellip; doctrines like &hellip; Monotheletism, Monenergism and others,when at the same time Christianity as a whole was being threatened by a totally new religion. — <a class="fn">	K-H Ohlig (2013) <span>‘Evidence of a New Religion in Christian Literature <q>Under Islamic Rule</q>?’	pp 176–307 in K-H Ohlig (ed) <cite>Early Islam</cite> (Prometheus, Amherst NYC): 176.</span></a></p><p class="epi">If Christendom had truly represented her Lord, Mohammed would have been a Christian. — <a class="fn">	WHT Gairdner (1920)<span> <cite>The Rebuke of Islam</cite> (United Council for Missionary Education, London): 4.</span></a></p><p><b>5a–Intention</b>.

To expiate it, he set out on a mission to Arabia, and reached Mecca, which he found inhabited by Jews and idolaters.

The variant words are <i>yay'as</i> (despair) and <i>yatabayyan</i> (learn), which would never be confused when heard, but — astonishingly — are nearly identical when written without diacritics (which were not used in ~32 AH).</p><p>Early critical analysis of the Quran was by people familiar with Biblical criticism, and traced many passages back to Judaeo-Christian texts. <a class="fn">Current analysts<span>	e.g., V Popp (2013) ‘From Ugarit to Samarra’ pp 14–173 in H-K Ohlig <cite>Early Islam</cite> (Prometheus, Amherst NYC).</span></a> are familiar with Syrian, Persian, Buddhist, Magian, and Hellenic material, which illuminates some of the more obscure passages.</p><p><b>6a–Timing</b>.

This is an easy mistake to make, and undoing it changes a <i>hapax legomen</i> into a known word. Often, it clears up a difficult reading — but far more important, it confirms an old conjecture that at least parts of the Quran were translated from Syriac (probably Christian lectionaries, or selections of daily readings). It further voids the Quran's claim that its original (in Paradise) is written in Arabic, the TA's claims that the Quran is an exact copy of the one in Paradise, and that Arabic is the mother tongue of Allah.

Unprofitable districts were privatized, initially by subsidizing tribal Arabs as mercenaries to keep Persians out of the borders. A charismatic war-leader Mohammed took advantage of the opportunity to weld the tribes into a substantial looting force. Looting being better outside of Arabia, raids under other war-leaders soon followed, with kill-the-men, distribute-the-women tactics until someone realized that the men could be used as slave soldiers in future raids. Later, given the importance of religion to controlling restive but gullible populations and facilitating tax collection in the Middle East, it seemed useful to administrators of conquered territories to create a religious justification for Arab hegemony.

In sharp contrast, the desert raiders of Arabia, like the people of the Middle Paleolithic, lived a changeless and unrecorded life which contracted the past so sharply that Muhamad understood Jesus to be the nephew of Moses.

This movement completely redefines Quranic Islam, overlooking all of Muhamad's barbarisms and excesses, and inventing an Islam-4 which flatly contradicts 1400 years of history. Its doctrine was set out in some 90 books by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Quadian at the end of the 19th century, and like most reform movements, claimed to be a return to a pristine predecessor. The flavor of the movement is captured by a <a class="fn">400-page effusion<span>	Ahmad of Quadian (various dates) ed. and tr.

To produce an Islam-4 to match post-Enlightenment expectations, Maulana ignores the recorded centuries of Islamic misery. To provide Islam-4 with the lovingkindness that gave the Christian myth its traction, he has only Shari’a's insistence that it provides Allah's required behavior in every situation.

This offended Mohammed's <i>amour propre</i>, and as soon as he no longer needed their support, he declared the Jews to be non-persons (‘dogs and pigs’ in the vernacular). 1400 years of experience shows that every time pragmatic leaders (e.g., Attaturk) have tried to reach Mohammed's dream of universal submission to Allah by relaxing the strictures of sharia, conservative demagogs (e.g., Erdogan) have cried foul.

Jews in Trans-Jordan <i>were</i> promptly expelled without benefit of planned destinations. Britain, exhausted by war and focused on soothing the Arabs who lay across the road to India, missed the chance to enforce settlement of the Arabs of Cis-Jordan in Arab territory.

This is a short-term view: Islam has maintained its 2-world outlook since Abu Haniffa (702–771) first used the term ‘Dar-al-Islam’ to define the territory where Islamic fatwas were legally binding. He coincidentally defined the rest of the world (Dar-al-Harb) as the area that was yet to be brought under Allah's control. And this remains the purpose of Islam. Since Allah and Islamic law offer nothing but retrogression and trouble to the West, we have gone to considerable effort to push Dar-al-Islam back into its Arabic homeland. This effort began with the Reconquista.</span></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Reconquista was the 771-year effort to drive the Moors out of Spain, from Duke Odo of Aquitain’s victory at the Battle of Toulouse in 721 to the recovery of Granada in 1492. In a broader view, it extended across Europe, including thousands of skirmishes and 82 major battles (noted by Wikipedia). This was followed by the Crusades, the Partition of India, the reclamation of part of Israel, and the 21st-century wars of the Balkans and southern Russia. Ultimately, it is the ongoing effort to undo the Arab Conquest and its millennial imposition of shari'a, mysogyny, stagnation, and Neolithic mores that stretches from Western Sahara to Sulawesi.</p><p>This is a long-term project.

Subsidizebookstores carrying translations of selected Western works of the last 3 centuries. Include DIY books, novels, self-improvement, children's stories — in short, anything that leads away from Sharia's Procrustean bed.<h4>Humanitarian Medical Aid</h4></li><li><b>Combat offers surgeons an unparalleled opportunity</b>to learn (which was one of the points made by M*A*S*H).

Explain that in spite of the manifold advances of its Golden Age, Islam has offered nothing to the world for the last 900 years. Explain that any doctrine backed by the deification of force would spread as long as it tolerated killing.

Humanist associations tend to attract the right sort of person for this job, and offer another source of well educated recruits.</li><h4>Humility and Logic</h4><p class="epi">Al-Qaeda took its name — meaning ‘database’ in Arabic — from the voluminous CIA database of jihadists — Mujahedeen foreign fighters and arms smugglers trained and equipped by the CIA during the Afghan conflict. — British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook </p><li><b>Undermine belief</b>. As many thoughtful students of Islam have noticed, the kindest thing one can do for Mohametans is to free them from their religion, and logic is a reasonable place to start. <i>Shirk</i> — attributing supernatural helpers (other gods, or intercessors) to Allah is Islam's worst sin. Assuming that a god needs mere <i>human</i> help is a claim that the god is impotent and can't run his own creation. Pure arrogance, and certainly a worse sin than <i>shirk</i>! <b>If Allah wanted infidels killed, he would do it himself.</b><br></li><li><b>Do not be fooled by Islamic <i>taqiyya</i></b>, the‘religious lie, &hellip; whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts’ or tell you that Islam is the Religion of Peace. If the purpose of religion is to keep us from killing eachother, Islam is not a religion at all. It is the distillation of the unconscious of an untrustworthy 7th-century nomad warlord.<br></li><li><b>Tell the truth about Islam</b>. It is not ‘Islamophobic’ to present the results of critical analysis! Jesus and Mohammed may both be largely mythical constructs, but Jesus helped people and healed them, while Mohammed had poets assassinated, led attacks on sleeping villages, and owned slaves. In both cases, the way to paradise is by emulating the prophet. Mohammed wanted infidels — anyone who didn't agree with him — killed; Allah, in his unconscious, agreed, and believing Mohametans are happy to oblige.<br><br>The Mohametan reaction to realistic portrayals of Muhamad in Western media is extreme, but the response is muted when ex-Mohametan Arabs on al Haya, the evangelical Arabic satellite station, do the same. This implies that our willingness to apologize for telling the truth is seenas weakness. No one has assassinated the Coptic priest Fr Zakaria Botros, who appears on al Haya, despite a reputed M$60 bounty posted by <a href="http://meforum.org/2650/what-did-you-say-about-Muhamad">al-Qaeda</a>.

Terrify the enemies of Allah and seek death &hellip;, for the worldly life will come to an end, and the hereafter will last forever. — <a href="http://www.meforum.org/4744/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-message-as-%20caliph">Abu Bakr al-Husayni al-Baghdadi, Caliph, ‘The Islamic State’ [formerly known as ISIS].</a></blockquote><p class="flu">I am a pacifist by nature and philosophy, and a conscientious objector — a position I maintained for 70 years, sure that Enlightenment rationality could solve the world's problems better than brute force. However, al-Baghdadi has issued a direct call for a renewal of the 1400-year ‘clash of civilizations’, and if the idea catches on among the faithful, this may have to be answered as we did at Constantinople (717), Tours (732), Lepanto (1571), Vienna (1683), and the ‘Shores of Tripoli’ (1829). The Bush wars seem to have been in aid of privatizing Middle Eastern oil, rather than protecting Enlightenment values.

(We may need another movie-actor President, able to say this with a straight face.) On the grounds that jihad is no longer accomplishing its purpose, he had suggested to Allah that Islam should abandon it: Jihad is <i>so</i> 7th-century that it is making Islam look foolish.</p><p><q>Allah replied</q>, says the President, <q>that he had tried many times to update Islam with corrective instructions via prophets, but every one had been killed for <i>bid’ah</i>, the terrible sin of innovation.</q> The President offered to help. Between them they agreed that the most effective way to reach Moslems was by demonstrating that Allah, although omnipotent, must himself obey the laws of the universe. Having granted us free will — a point not understood by Muhamad, whose highest concept of power was slavery (‘But’, interjected Allah, ‘what use are slaves to an omnipotent god?’). — Allah cannot thereafter intervene in human affairs. Nor can we have both free will and inflexible recommendations for behavior, such as Shari'a. The fact that Allah allows no helpers means 3 things:</p><br><ul><li>There is no one to intercede between you and Allah's judgement of your behavior;<br><br></li><li>No one but you — not the imam, not the ulema, not Shari'a, not a prophet, not Jibreel — can make your decisions for you; you alone are responsible for your actions and you face your god alone;<br><br></li><li>Just as no one else is responsible for your decisions, you are not responsible for theirs. There is no compulsion in religion; what others believe is between them and their god, and it is of no concern to you. You are not Allah's helper; you are not Allah's servant. Gods have no use for such piddling help. Slave to Muhamad's befuddled interpretation you may be, but that is your choice. Thinking that you can ‘help’ Allah is arrogance and <i>shirk</i>. Omnipotence needs no human fumbling! Your tribal duties are to say the shahada, fast, pray, go on pilgrimage, and pay taxes. That's it. Allah is only a tribal god.

There will be an attempt to make the punishment fit the crime: minor minarets for minor crimes; the minarets of Hagia Sophia and al-Haram for serious attacks.

It appears that the Turks, with the double handicap of Asiatic indifference to human life and Moslem perception of infidels as domestic animals, indulged in genocide and ethnic cleansing with enthusiasm. ‘Few crimes against humanity have been so widely and so comprehensively ignored’ by Western intellectuals, says King's College(London) Professor <a class="fn">	Efraim Karsh<span> E Karsh (2013) ‘Ankara's Unacknowledged Genocide: Turkey, Past and Future’ <cite>Middle East Q</cite> Winter 2013: 17–26.</span></a>.

Among the more fortunate Armenians were the ones driven into the Syrian desert: Some of them survived.</p><p>After WW II, there were major resettlements of displaced people in Europe which occasioned little or no comment. After WW I, there was a massive formal population exchange, or mutual surgun (essentially a belated regularizing of the Turkic conquest of Anatolia (~1070 CE) and international recognition of the futility of a multicultural Moslem-majority state). In 1923, 1.5 million Greeks were moved out ofIonian territory invaded by the Turks, with rather fewer Mohametans moved out of Greece. Astonishingly, there has been only <a class="fn">one analysis<span>	R Hirschon (ed) (2003) <cite>Crossing the Aegean: An Appraisal of the 1923 Compulsory Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey</cite> (Berghahn, Oxford).</span></a> of the result. Resettled wheat farmers burned olive groves for firewood, and folksongs inspired thoughts of revanche, but (as of 2016) Turks and Greeks have not found it necessary to kill eachother since. (Still, the last time I tried to obtain topographic maps for some off-trail mountain climbing in Greece they were not available. ‘No point in letting the Turks know where our <a class="fn">mountain passes<span> In the event, it didn't matter. The mountains of Greece are one big network of goat trails, offering 100,000 ways up Mt Parnassus. </span></a> are!’, explained the clerk.) This exchange stopped the neighborly killing, kept the peace for 90 years, let 2 nations get on with their lives, and won its administrator (oceanographer Fritdjof Nansen) a Nobel Peace Prize. Postmodernists do not like population exchanges because they subjugate some individual rights to collectivewelfare — but isn't that a definition of ‘civilization’? <a class="fn">Yoram Hazony<span> 	Y Hazony (2010) ‘Israel Through European Eyes’ <cite>Jerusalem Letters</cite> 2010-07-14. [Hazony is worth reading.]</span></a> suggests that a post-WWII paradigm shift, from the nation state as vehicle of civic aspirations, to the international council asarbiter of dispute, is responsible for their current unpopularity. Received wisdom today is that population exchange is a denial of human rights. (My personal view is that the Highland Clearance was the best thing that ever happened to my ancestors — if not for the ones who weremurdered, at least for the ones who were surgunned. Some of the ones who stayed put were still living in the Middle Ages when the Industrial Revolution passed them by; some of those sent to the Irish Plantations made it to the US when it was still the land of the free.)</p><p>The Arabs of Israel were a group self-selected for initiative. Following the advice of the Quran,</p><blockquote>4:97 Those whose lives are terminated by the angels, while in a state of wronging their souls, the angels will ask them, ‘What was the matter with you?’ They will say, ‘We were oppressed on earth.’ They will say, ‘Was GOD's earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ For these, the final abode is Hell, and a miserable destiny.</blockquote><p class="flu">and feeling economically or politically oppressed in their Islamic homelands, they came from 33 countries to work for the Israeli settlers. Whatever genetic impetus there was for initiative apparently disappeared (by <a class="fn">reversion to the mean<span>	This term seems to mean different things to different people. Here, it means that exceptional character traits are likely to be polygenic, depending on a chance assembly of parental alleles, which will not necessarily be passed on because each parent contributes a random half of the alleles of the next generation. ‘Exceptional families’ seldom last more than 3 generations.</span></a> in a couple of generations). More to the point, the conditions of Q4:97 no longer apply: the earth is no longer ‘spacious enough for [them] to emigrate therein’ to escape oppression, because their sparsely settled Arab kin states create artificial barriers to their return. I once thought it curious that none of the few Arab leaders who have honestly sought an acceptable resolution to Palestinian misery has made Q4:97 its centerpiece — until I realized that such leaders were not the ones who spent much time reading the Quran.</p><p>The effectiveness of the ancient practice of surgun is overlooked by well meaning people who	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-SoapBox3.gif" alt="Soap-Box"></a>sympathizewith the Arab refugees. What happened during the establishment of Israel was an informal population exchange. Approximately 750,000 Arabs left Cis-Jordan, often at the behest of Arab military who expected to return them to their homes quickly. A roughly equal number of Jews were expelled, penniless, from Arab countries, to settle in Cis-Jordan. The fog of war ensured that the ‘exchange’ was neither orderly nor welldocumented. Israel has released its documents, and they have been analyzed by <a class="fn">revisionist historians,<span>	E.g., the ‘definitive work’ was by Benny Morris — but Ephraim Karsh notes that ‘While laying blame for the Palestinian refugee crisis on the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces and its pre-state precursor, the Haganah, Morris failed to consult the millions of declassified documents in their archives, even as other historians — among them: Uri Milstein, Shabtai Teveth, Elhannan Orren, Michael Bar-Zohar, Dan Kurzman, Yitzhak Levi, Yuval Arnon-Ohana, and Shmuel Dotan — used them in painstaking research’.

In each case, kindly editors advised me to send it to some extremist Zionist magazine: <i>they</i> wouldn't touch such a sensitive matter.

But Bartal emphasizes the structural unfairness of the</p><blockquote>demonstrated and direct link between the de factoresettlement of the Palestinian refugees and the confiscation of their property by Israel and the expulsion of the Jews from the Arab states and the confiscation of their assets by the various Arab governments {40}.</blockquote><p>This too may look like balanced misery, but its unfairness is economic. The expelled Jews were often wealthy professionals living in 1000-year-old communities, while the refugee Arabs were primarily middle-class descendants of impoverished recent immigrants. Like the numbers of refugees, their net worth is difficult to compare because the ‘fog of war and politics’ meant that few records were kept. Bartalestimates that in today's dollars, the Arab refugees lost G$3.4 (citing a 1950 UN estimate), while the Jews lost G$100 (citing <a class="fn">	Martin Gilbert).<span>(2010) <cite>In Ishmael's House, A History of Jews in Muslim Lands</cite> (Yale University Press, Cornwall).</span></a></p><p>Nor is there imbalance in the re-establishment of Israel itself: In the 7th century, Arabs occupied an Israel devastated by the Romans; the Jews took it back in the 20th. Think of this as a continuation of the 770-year Reconquista (722–1492 CE) which drove the Moors (<i>and Jews</i>) out of Spain. Moslems may still think this needs correcting, but it is no longer on our list of atrocities, and they shouldn't have invaded Spain in the first place. The agitation over Cis-Jordan seems like poorly disguised Judaeophobia. (The imbalance of the conquests is that the Arabs, following behavior taught by role-model Muhamad, were likely to have killed the men and distributed the women as slaves.)</p><p>If there is any more to the <i>popoco</i> abuse of Israel than a lingering urge for a final solution to ‘the Jewish problem’, it is the <i>perceived</i> imbalance that arises because Jews took care of their refugees, while the Arabs deliberately kept theirs in misery for propaganda use. Granted, Israel — despite the number of Jewish public-relations professionals around the world — has never presented its case effectively. (This has to be one of the major failures in world diplomacy, and I do not understand it unless it be in some way attributable to the cryptic Judaeophobia that persists, particularly in urope, among academics, editors, and politicians. If America is unable to believe that it is not at the peak of all measures of desirability, Europe seems unable to accept responsibility for its own problems, and earnestly continues to seek a scapegoat.)</p><p>We never hear about the Jewish refugees because Israel spent G$10 to integrate them.

See Lindsay (2009) for a senior insider's view (disliked, without provision of corrective examples, by UNRWA management). His major conclusion:<br>	‘UNRWA has gradually adopted a distinctive political viewpoint that favors the Palestinian and Arab narrative of events in the Middle East.

Arab leaders like Syria's Prime Minister Husni Za'im, who publicly suggested that their countries could use some settlers, accepting the principle of population exchange, were assassinated by Moslems who regard Cis-Jordan as an Allah-conquered part of Dar-al-Islam and need the misery of the Arab refugees as a political lever in the hope of persuading the UN to delegitimize Israel. The original partition of Mandate Palestine to create the ‘Two-State Solution’ — theoretically by Faisal and Weizmann in 1919, and tactically by Abdullah and Churchill in 1922 — was along the river Jordan, giving 74% of its area (Trans-Jordan/South Syria/Jordan) to the Arabs and 26% (Cis-Jordan/Israel) to the Jews. <b>Abdullah promptly drove the Jews out of Trans-Jordan</b>, but the Western commentariat laments the plight of the Arab refugees and sees nothing wrong with sectarian cleansing.

The onus is on Islam to change this behavior, but it appears to be an essential component of Mohammetism. I cannot find one country, with a Moslem fraction between 10% and 90%, where Moslems have co-existed peaceably with ‘infidels’ for a decade under civil law, without agitating for special treatment under shari'a. I cannot find one country under Moslem rule in which minorities have the suite of rights in the <cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</cite> (and yes, I am aware that the US is deficient here also, and that feudofascist Republicans work tirelessly to create a plutocracy for the pink-(and orange)-skinned wealthy, but that is truly a separate process, not pursued by democide, but by suborning lawmakers).</p><p>Palestinian leaders do not want an independent state. <a class="fn">	Ephraim Karsh<span>(2014) ‘Palestinian Leaders Don't Want an Independent State’ <cite>Middle East Q</cite> <b>XXI</b>.</span></a> points out the 3 reasons for this:</p><ul><li><b>Pan-Arab delusion</b>. Through 1400 years of internecine warfare, Arab theologians have maintained the vision of a single caliphate (ultimately to rule the world — with them in charge).</li><li><b>Islamic ideals</b>. Islam is to be the world's only religion. The problem is that Islam tells each sect that it, and it alone, is right and the others are infidels. Hence the infighting among Moslem states yesterday, today, and tomorrow.</li><li>‘<b>Vast financial and political gains</b> attending the perpetuation of Palestinian misery’.

Given Gaza, other once-conquered territories are appropriate targets of jihad — as is the rest of Dar-al-Harb, where Islam has yet to be enforced, particularly Western countries in which Islamic enclaves are already established.

Islamic jurisconsults regard the presence of these enclaves as sufficient justification to consider the rest of the country as belonging to Dar-al-Islam, temporarily occupied by (expendable) infidels.
