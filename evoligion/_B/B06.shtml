<p class="epi">Sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers have all sought to analyze and understand &lsquo;<i>Homo religiosus</i>&rsquo; and have put forward various hypotheses to explain the strong and often contagious hold that religion has over human individuals and societies. Yet none of these attempts, although providing plausible reasons why religion can help in our daily lives, has so far led to a consistent naturalistic explanation for how religious behavior first developed and became established. &mdash; <a class="fn">W Schiefenh&ouml;vel, E Voland (2009)°<span>

<h3><a href="#TOC"> Something Missing </a></h3>
<a class="tri" href="#03">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>The revival of independent thought that accompanied the end of the Middle Ages led to critical thinking about religion. As always when there is little understanding, there are many ideas about what religion <i>is</i>. The problem is that of the blind men describing the elephant: one can only describe what he comes in contact with. One or two of the theories anticipate the direction we are going. Most of them ignore the central paradox, the nearly universal pothodoxy that powers religion. Yet belief &mdash; while it thrives on ignorance &mdash; has lost its hold on many intellectuals, Scandinavians, and the lapsed Anglicans of England, so that religion for many in the West is only a social gesture or voluntary discipline. Why was belief once useful? Why is it now superfluous and often detrimental? Theories which fail to answer these questions are missing something essential.

<h3><a href="#TOC"> Three Strands to Plait </a></h3>
<a class="tri" href="#04">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>To begin a search for the missing bit, we put previous work in perspective with a brief review. There are 3 strands to follow. The first is descriptive and examines what the many have <i>done</i> about religion, including the varieties of gods we worship and how we represent them. The second is analytical and examines what philosophers have <i>thought</i> about religion. The third strand (<a href="../_B/B07.shtml#B07">Ch. 7</a>) looks at anomalous features of religion which may guide us toward its real purpose. The first 2 strands suffer from the limitations of history, for writing came to us some 30 millennia later than religion.

<a class="trs" href="#05">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
<a class="tri" href="#17">&ensp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>The traditional classification of religion counts gods. Cultural evolutionist Sir E.B. Tylor thought religion improved by reducing this number: animism progressed to primitive polytheism; polytheism was refined and gave way to monotheism. In contrast, Folklorist Andrew Lang held that foragers tend to be monotheist; farmers and herders, polytheist. Such debates form an important part of theology &mdash; yet it is not always clear what is meant by <i>mono</i>- and <i>poly</i>-. We are dealing with metaclassifications, comparing structures which are defined differently in different contexts. When religions do not recognize eachother&apos;s supernatural structure, how does one make meaningful comparisons? How do we classify incompatible supernatural beings like Catholic saints and the minor gods of Hinduism? How many gods are there when one is an avatar of another? Is a monotheism with angels and djinns distinguishable from polytheism? How, exactly, does a god with 99 names differ from 99 gods?
</p>

<h3><a href="#TOC"> Afterlives On Offer </a></h3>
<a class="tri"  href="#06">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p class="epi">If I saw no signs of a divinity, I would fix myself in denial. If I saw everywhere the marks of a Creator, I would repose peacefully in faith. But seeing too much to deny Him, and too little to assure me, I am in a pitiful state, and I would wish a hundred times that if a god sustains nature it would reveal Him without ambiguity. &mdash; Pascal.
</p>

<p>The classification that counts gods was invented by Christian theologians arguing against the Classical polytheisms. In doing so, they overlooked a possibly more meaningful classification. Its counting system goes &lsquo;Zero, One, Many&rsquo;, and it counts the number of chances we have to prepare for eternity (or whatever comes next, if anything).
</p>

<p><b>Zero</b>. Maimonides waffled on the question of resurrection, apparently preferring to believe in spiritual immortality as a reward for obtaining correct knowledge of god. Other rabbis disagreed. Perhaps recognizing the undecidability of the question, and accepting a form of Pascal&apos;s wager, Judaism is largely unconcerned with the &lsquo;afterlife&rsquo;. What matters is how well we do with the life we have. A capsule description is: &lsquo;Live as though you were going to die tomorrow. Study as though you were going to live forever.&rsquo; Many Nobel Prizes result. Confucianism shares this real-world focus.
</p>

<p><b>One</b>. The other Abrahamic religions are one-shot structures with an other-world focus requiring massive overbelief. Philosophically, they lead to the logical impasses of inquisitions and predestination. Their greatest weaknesses are a direct result of this other worldly orientation: a lack of concern for the future, the physical world, and other species.
</p>

<p><b>Many</b>. Most &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo; religions hold that souls evolve by trial and error, and that this is the purpose of the world. If we don&apos;t get it right this time, we repeat the lesson in our next life. Logically, this should lead to the same real-world results as the 0-shot approach, but the system is commonly subverted by the idea that one&apos;s lifetime status is fixed at birth and cannot be improved until the next cycle. Few Nobel Prizes result.
</p>

<p>Purgatory is the Catholic approach to correcting Christianity&apos;s one-shot approach. With enough prayers and masses, sinners can reap vicarious atonement and move on to Heaven. The only detectable philosophical justification for this is that it makes the church a profit.
</p>

<p>Like many aspects of religion, the reality of the afterlife is an undecidable question. No known physics supports the idea, and no evidence save cultural memories and personal experience of bicameral conversations with the dead. Anyone who has experienced such a &lsquo;contact&rsquo; will not be lightly persuaded that it is internal. All that is needed to resolve this question is reception of repeatable, publicly verifiable data. Alas, this has not been forthcoming in 150 years of patient investigation under laboratory conditions. Believers attribute this failing to difficulties experienced by the dead in reaching us.
</p>

<p>My personal response to this logical impasse is that if I had designed the universe, I would have tried to include reincarnation. Given the challenge presented in the front end papers, the idea of implacable karmic retribution is an appealing implementation of social justice, if a bit too slow for my taste.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pascal&apos;s Wager&rsquo; holds that while we cannot decide the truth of the matter, if the 1-shot Abrahamic view is correct, the payoff &mdash; the difference between an eternity of heaven or hell &mdash; is infinite. <i>Because</i> we cannot know the truth, we cannot evade the payoff by denial. Therefore it behooves the rational person to live well, while trying very hard to believe. What we might call the Buddhist version of Pascal&apos;s Wager is that the prudent person will act as though reincarnation <a class="fn">were in effect°.<span>
	Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death among adolescents, 4 times higher for boys than girls. Two of my male teen-age friends (well behaved, upright Christians, before the days of drugs) committed suicide in the 1940s, when the offical view &mdash; promulgated by pundits who had repressed their own adolescence? &mdash; was &lsquo;true depression [is] not possible at this development point&rsquo;. Hmph! My view at the time was that one&apos;s outlook was warped by depression, so I should wait until I felt optimistic before killing myself, <i>because the problems would be more severe next time around</i>. This worked. <br>-----------------<br>

</span></a>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a <i>population</i> preoccupied with the 1-shot&apos;s afterlife indicates a failed state, in which the common estimation is that life is miserable and nothing can be done to improve it, so let&apos;s hope for something better afterwards. Since people are naturally optimistic, this defeatist attitude is the result of socio-political failure that can only be achieved by a truly disastrous government.

<h3><a href="#TOC">The Standard Classification</a></h3>
<a class="tri"  href="#07">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>Hereafter we follow Schleiermacher&apos;s taxonomy: the more advanced a religion, the more systematic its theology. It is a logical way to order them, but it does not mean that religions develop systematically. The polytheisms in the middle of our list may be highly systematic.

	For this manuring by cutting and burning.&rsquo;<br>
	 &mdash; from the Breton song <i>Jannedik-flamme</i>, or <i>Jeanne of the Flame</i>: her words as she looked over the night&apos;s work. In 1341, she led a sally from the beleaguered Anglo-Norman castle of Henbont, to burn tents and cut throats. The French, 3000 strong, had partied late, thinking the siege would be a piece of cake since the lady&apos;s husband was incarcerated by the King. 100 of them survived the party.

</span></a> so we should offer it as a sacrifice to the god of crops. The <cite>Gathas</cite> of Zoroaster are among our oldest religious texts. Hymns exalting Ahura Mazda, they are the epitome of nature worship. Already confounding god-counting, they combine &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; nature worship with &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; monotheism. Iranian <cite>Gathas</cite> and Hindu <cite>Vedas</cite> differ only in dialect, not content, yet Zoroaster was a strict monotheist and Hindus abundantly polytheist.

<h4><a href="#TOC"> Animism </a></h4>
<a class="tri"  href="#09">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>The line between nature worship and animism is blurred: &lsquo;We know that people have separable parts that can leave the body for adventures at night. Animals also dream, so probably everything, including rocks and rivers, has a spirit body. The world is full of spirits who can both help and harm; the rules for dealing with them are complex and don&apos;t always work. It is worth keeping a shaman who understands these things, even if he is an inept hunter and we have to feed him.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;The supply of prey is not constant. We must do everything possible to maximize it, apologizing for killing them, and explaining why we have to do it. We have to persuade their souls to reincarnate locally, and not abandon us. If we can kill them as painlessly as possible, they might be more likely to return. We must never kill needlessly, or let food go to waste.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>There is a premonition here of sound environmental ethics, but it was neither universal nor articulated. Animism may have been the norm during the <a class="fn">Pleistocene Overkill°<span>

<h4><a href="#TOC"> Totemism </a></h4>
 <a class="tri"  href="#10">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>While totems are known primarily from non-Western and generally less developed cultures, the Lowenmensch from the Swabian Hohlenstein-Stadel cave (~40ka), is a totemic object from the early days of Europe. In any case, totemism flourished wherever the world divided into relatives and enemies, for it increased the one and decreased the other. A tribe is generally a few kinship groups, and people in your own tribe seldom try to kill you on sight. On the other hand, it is a small gene pool and may lose alleles until a passing virus wipes it out. In the New Guinea Highlands, omnihostile tribes have genetic abnormalities and co-evolutionary diseases not known in their neighbors. Exogamy is genetically desirable, but in the Paleolithic, any meeting with strangers with the chimpanzee mind-set of killing the stranger was risky.
</p>

<p>Totemism is a logical solution. It divides a wontok into moieties in such a way that each tribe has members of each totem. Thus one has synthetic kin who can be safely approached in every tribe, even if the tribe as a whole would happily kill you. This facilitates trading, and swapping of women. The laws of magic then mean that you cannot mate with women of your <a class="fn">own totem.<span>
	JG Frazier (1910) <cite>Totemism and Exogamy,</cite> 4 vols (Macmillan, London).
</span></a> (although Frazier makes it clear that the association between totemism and exogamy was not universal among the studied tribes). I will go out on a limb and suggest that in the day &mdash; some tens of thousands of years earlier &mdash; the association was stronger, and that its importance declined as population and variety increased. The clever invention was the earliest form of <b>synthetic kinship</b>:
&lsquo;The other tribe is not entirely foreign. Some of them share a common ancestor with me, so I can negotiate with them and don&apos;t need to kill them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mythic ancestor is often an animal, but may be anything. This, however, is an afterthought:
</p>

<p><blockquote>[T]he belief in this descent is a mere explanatory myth to account for totemism; and, like all other such myths, could only arise after men were not only totemic, but wondered why they were totemic.  Consequently such myths are not of the essence of totemism, and their varieties are of no importance. &mdash; <a class="fn">Andrew Lang°<span> (1911) <Cite>Method in the Study of Totemism</cite> (Robert Maclehose, Glasgow): Ch. 3.
</span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">The real function is the prevention of gene loss by inbreeding: the existence of relatives among The Others is sufficient to allow exogamic wife exchange and minimize inbreeding. This increases viability, so any mutation which favors totemism will be reinforced. The often puzzling association between totemism and incest is a logical vextension of tribal incest rules to the totem. The optimum biological rule is that you don&apos;t marry within your tribe; marriage within your totem from another tribe confers no genetic disadvantage, but is prohibited for consistency. The topic seems understudied. <a class="fn">Martin Wobst°<span>

<h4><a class="tri" href="#11">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>

<p>This nearly universal practice also furnishes clues to the function of religion. Now that we know about bicameral voices, &lsquo;consultation&rsquo; is a more accurate description than &lsquo;worship&rsquo;, for ancestors are asked for advice &mdash; and provide it. This preserves the wisdom of previous generations for the guidance of the living. As noted <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#25">earlier</a>, the practice survived into the mid-20th century in Madagascar.

<h4><a href="#TOC"> Polytheism </a></h4>
<a class="tri" href="#12">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>


<p>The division of labor in the first urban cultures generated a god for each occupation. These were humans writ large, with specific duties and peaceful coexistence. The variety of gods increases the explanatory power of polytheism, and provides an obvious answer to the problem of evil, since polytheisms mimic the human family. The pantheon is the precursor of the soap opera, displaying human dramas in mythic form that pervades the culture as entertainment and example.
</p>

<p>Olympus was an uneasy company of 6 male and 6 female gods. Robert Graves saw this as a compromise between a native matriarchal chthonic religion and the male sky gods of Dorian invaders. If so, score another victory for Greek rationalism. The division of labor within the pantheon &mdash; the Romans had over 200 gods, although some, like Cardea, goddess of thresholds and door pivots, had minimal responsibility &mdash; makes polytheisms naturally tolerant, often extending this courtesy to foreign gods. In this respect they are a considerable advance over monotheisms.
</p>

<p>When we first meet Olympus, Zeus and the boys clearly outrank Hera and the girls, but this was not always so. Zeus (written Δεος, ie, &lsquo;god&rsquo;) is <i>Dyaus pater</i> is Ju-piter, god-the-father, and like monotheistic gods, often addressed as father of the human race. Yet knowledge of paternity came late to humans, and before Zeus&apos;s time the Great Mother was <i>the</i> ancestor.

 Zeus at work. An Aegean event 1000 times the size of this Icelandic eruption was the final blow to the dominance of the Goddess (whatever local names she went by). What people saw, transmitted orally for 800 years before Hesiod wrote it down, was a sky god hurling thunderbolts to subdue Gaia&apos;s monstrous offspring Typhœus. Poseidon, Earth-shaker and god of the sea, and Hades, god of the underworld, were also present at this battle, if less in the public eye. Photo: <a class="fn">Anderson°.<span>

<p>The early children of Gaia, the earth, are shadowy but kindly. Her later children tend to be destructive monsters. Hesiod tells of a fight between Zeus and Typhœus, described as a towering black giant with blood running down his heel and Zeus&apos;s lightning flashing around his head. To an earth scientist, Hesiod reads like an eyewitness account (after 800 years of <a class="fn">oral transmission°)<span>
	California Indians transmitted valid geological information about the eruption of Mt Mazama (Crater Lake) for 7500 years, so there is nothing remarkable about the Mediterranean transmission. Thoreau&apos;s Walden Pond was once an ice hill &mdash; an insulated remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet &mdash; surrounded by glacial outwash, until it melted and turned into a &lsquo;bottomless&rsquo; pond. Local Indian tradition recalled the event, which might have happened 10,000 years earlier.

<p>The tsunami from Thera destroyed many coastal cities in the Aegean, and did Gaia&apos;s reputation no good at all. I see this as the beginning of the decline of female gods and matrism in the Mediterranean, for as Hesiod noted,

<a href="#TOC"   id="13"> Henotheism/Kathenotheism/Monolatry </a>
<a class="tri" href="#14">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Max Müller coined the first 2 terms to describe nuances between polytheism and monotheism. Henotheism is a courteous system which worships a single god, while acknowledging the gods worshipped by others. The Olympic pantheon was henotheistic from Zeus&apos;s point of view. The other gods existed and could be worshipped, but he could override them.
</p>

<p>Monolatry is one step from henotheism, in that the other gods, while still present, are <i>not</i> worthy of worship.
</p>

<p>Kathenotheism is serial henotheism. Many Vedic hymns are addressed to Indra, but &lsquo;Indra&rsquo; is a title rather than a name (-<i>endra</i> means &lsquo;chief&rsquo;). Thus Prahlâda was Indra at one time, and Nahusha at another. Just as all US Presidents are announced with &lsquo;Hail to the Chief&rsquo;, so too could hymns to Indra be used for different gods.
</p>

<p>YHVH disregarded Müller&apos;s distinctions. He wanted henotheism in Ex 20:3, &lsquo;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&rsquo;; then monotheism, &lsquo;There is none else besides him&rsquo; {Deut 4:35}; monolatry, &lsquo;Ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire&rsquo; {Deut 7:5}; monotheism, &lsquo;to whom belong the heavens and the earth&rsquo; {Deut 10:14}; and again henotheism, &lsquo;He is God of gods, and Lord of lords&rsquo; {Deut 32:39}. The Jews eventually settled on monotheism, making the Shema the preferred version: &lsquo;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD&rsquo; {Deut 6:5}.
</p>

<p>In the <cite>Brihad-aranyaka Upanishad</cite> III.9.1 the number of Hindu gods is sequentially reduced from 3003 to 303 to 33 to 6 to 3 to 2 <a class="fn">to 1.5 to 1°.<span>
	The 6 gods are fire, the earth, the air, the sky, the sun and heaven. The 3 gods are &lsquo;the 3 worlds&rsquo;. The 2 gods are water and vital breath. The 1.5 gods are &lsquo;This air that blows&rsquo;, with explanation, &lsquo;Concerning this some say: &ldquo;Since the air blows as one substance, how can it be one and a half (<i>adhyardha</i>)?&rdquo; The answer is: It is one and a half because by its presence everything attains surpassing glory (<i>adhyardhnot</i>).&rsquo; [Superficially, this is a pun. Or perhaps it is a key to a deeper truth.] I trust this clears up the question of fractional gods.

<p>As in Greece, what the populace sees as polytheism is understood by the thoughtful as monotheism. &lsquo;The Gayatri is Brahma is Vishnu is Shiva is the Vedas&rsquo; says one text. Gayatri is variously described as an ancient solar mantra, a poetic meter of the Veda, and a 5-headed goddess in her own right. Such complexities tend to reduce academic classifications to mincemeat.

<p>The tension between a polarized dyad can explain nearly anything. Such dyads are the raw material of drama and art, and include good/evil, light/dark, idea/embodiment, heaven/earth, atman/brahman, life/death, yin/yang, chaos/order, male/female, love/discord, body/spirit, god/devil, truth/error, sacred/profane, &amp;c. How could religion escape such a convenient concept? Often, the personifications of the dyad are family members: siblings, or parent and offspring. In others they are opposing divinities; or aspects of a single god like Vishnu and Shiva, or a god and sidekick like the Great Spirit and Coyotl. Even Parsiism, originally the most emphatic monotheism, could not long do without God&apos;s Enemy, and in later forms Ahura Mazda and Ahriman are almost equal. Satan is absent from the Torah except for the snake in the (interpolated?) <i>Potter&apos;s Tale</i>. He is introduced in Job to resolve the problem of evil, but receives only slight mention thereafter, not reappearing until 1 Chronicles 21, where he instigates burocracy. He becomes important in the Epistles, and is a great favorite with evangelical Christians and, of course, Satanists. He is invoked by Muslims to explain why Islam has not spread across the world.
</p>

<p>The effective dyads as seen by the Frankfurt &lsquo;<b>critical theory</b>&rsquo; include 15 antagonisms: gender, generations, economic class, race, nationality, individual/collective, political right/left, order/progress, revolutionary/authoritarian, state/society, <a class="fn">language/work°,<span>
	Glossed as &lsquo;linguistically mediated interaction of the bourgeoisie vs tool-mediated labor of the proletariat&rsquo;. In the US vernacular, this would be &lsquo;white-collar/blue-collar&rsquo;.
</span></a> conscious individuality vs collective unconscious, efficiency/humanity, religious/secular, and man/nature. Even if these conflicts once played a positive and productive role in society, the amount of suffering they produce is so enormous that their continuation is undesirable. Optimistically, the conflicts are expected to end when &lsquo;monotheism is reconciled with <a class="fn">radical enlightenment°<span>

</span></a> wrote a story in which Akhnaton invented monotheism and taught it to Moses, who took the Jews and ran with it. Akhnaton was the first to see that polytheism was the answer to priestly unemployment; the priests retaliated by chipping his name off every wall in Egypt after he died. But the idea spread, and we now have 3 Abrahamic monotheisms that agree that there is but a single god &mdash; adding, &lsquo;But my god is better than your god&rsquo; &mdash; or, as <a class="fn">Asma°<span>

<p>Some think monotheism answered the natural question of polytheism, &lsquo;Who created the gods?&rsquo; &mdash; but it does this only by postulating a &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;, and thus uncreated, god. This is a word game. A creator is, from both experience and logic, more complicated than his creations. Monotheism thus explains a complex entity (the universe) as having been created by a more complex uncreated entity (a god) &mdash; but this only makes the problem more difficult. Why not accept the simpler entity as uncreated and &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;? In any case, monotheism, or monarchianism (belief in a single divine ruler), became an official Christian heresy after the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity at Nicea in 325 (although ¾ of the attending bishops walked out <a class="fn">over the decision°).<span>

<p>Xenophanes observed that the gods of horses would look like horses. On the other hand, we ourselves have been called the lesser gods of animals. These are not necessarily incompatible views. Lumpkin, a grey tabby rescue cat, appreciated that I could answer prayers, perform miracles, dispense boons, open the fridge, and otherwise fill the role of a lesser god. She <i>also</i> saw me as a poorly trained kitten. Turning up her nose when I offered a bit of my (vegetarian) dinner, she left, to return in 5 minutes with a crippled mouse, which she deposited at my feet. Her body language was unmistakable: &lsquo;Get down here and learn to catch <i>food</i>. Now!&rsquo; If a cat brain can hold wildly conflicting views on the nature of godhood, is it any wonder that <a class="fn">ours do also°?<span>
	I later sold Lumpkin for $10,000. I figured the house would go for $105,000, but the buyer offered $115,000 &lsquo;if I&apos;d throw in the cat&rsquo;. Since the buyer was a woman, and Lumpkin had long since made clear her preference (to me, and evidently to the buyer) for a carnivorous woman as her person, this made everyone happy.

</h4>

<p>Theism describes a personal god who oversees his handiwork and tinkers with it, sometimes on demand. Theism depends upon revelation, for many theologians conclude that all we can know of god is what he reveals. This mind-set generates 2 of the most troubling questions of theology: the problem of evil, and that of the &lsquo;intimate other&rsquo;:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How can an omnibenevolent monotheist god permit natural evil (earthquakes, illness)?</li>
<li>How can Rudolf Otto&apos;s &lsquo;wholly other&rsquo; be known at all; and how can it be encountered as a person?</li>
</ul>


<p>The latter dilemma results from not understanding bicamerality, in which the &lsquo;sensed entity&rsquo; of the right hemisphere is perceived as external, yet it is intimate, personal, and &mdash; because it knows the innermost secrets of the left-hemisphere persona &mdash; simultaneously projects immanence, omnipotence and omniscience. Once this perception is established by bicameral experience it is perpetuated by dogma, faith, and pothodoxy as bicamerality fades.

<a class="tri" href="#18">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Pantheism, meaning &lsquo;Everything is god&rsquo; was coined in 1705 to describe religions which see the universe as identical to, or the only manifestation of, an immanent god. In the West, the concept was popularized by Zeno and the Stoics. &lsquo;No part can be sentient where the whole is not sentient; parts of the universe are sentient, therefore the universe is sentient&rsquo; &mdash; hence the universe must be animate, rational, wise, and divine. (Did Zeno never cut his hair?) Pantheism comes in many flavors, which we need not elaborate.
</p>

<p>Pantheists hold that the Universe itself possesses the attributes of divinity, such as power, magnificence, and grandeur, and so regard it as sacred. It is all that is, ever was, or ever will be. Contact with the sacred is <a href="http://www.pantheism.net/">sought</a> in the natural world, through the arts and sciences, ethical action, and planetary stewardship (rather than revealed doctrine, saviors, or holy writ), and thus is better suited to today&apos;s needs than any of the monotheisms.
</p>

<p>Panentheism, meaning &lsquo;Everything is <i>in</i> god&rsquo; was coined in 1828 to describe a variant of pantheism in which the finite world is only a portion of the infinite god.

</h4>

<p>Conscious, rational, cortical thinkers unimpressed by dogma often hold that reason rather than revelation is the proper approach to religion. This is Deism, which preserves the essence of the Torah (while discarding its antiquated legalisms), and the essence of Jesus&apos;s teachings (while discarding bicameral Pauline and Johanine mythopoesis). Our first 4 presidents &mdash; among them, the writers of the Constitution &mdash; were Deists. To this fact we owe the 200-year success of Constitutional government and the early image of America as the land of freedom and opportunity.
</p>

<p>Today Deism is better known for the reaction it inspired, epitomized by the <a class="fn"><cite>Chicago Statements°,</cite><span>
	Two formal position papers from the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy, which met in Chicago (1978-10-26&ndash;28 and 1982-11-10&ndash;13). The organizing Coalition on Revival has issued a comprehensive series of papers on &lsquo;biblical principles for all spheres of human life including theology, evangelism, discipleship, law, civil governments, economics, education, family, medicine, psychology and counseling, arts and media, business and professions, and science and technology&rsquo;: In short, a theocracy as comprehensively stifling as that of the Dark Ages or Islam. The  fundamentalist movement has completely failed to understand the Enlightenment roots of the Deist founders of the US government.

<p>The series of Reversions is more or less as shown in Table 6.1, although some would have a series of 5, leading respectively to the Revolutionary war, the Civil War and abolition, the Populist and Progressive Movements, the New Deal, and the Great Society and feminism, with never a downside to be seen. It is clear that we are looking at a very ill defined and subjective sequence here, but I see decreasing ethics and increasing dogma in political expression, with Reversion I working for Enlightenment fundamentals, II and III resolving nagging left-overs, and IV the result of the deliberate stultifying of the Bible Belt population, and entirely out of touch with the purpose of religion.
</p>

<p>There are indications of a counter reaction to the political excesses of the Reversionists, with a modest increase in the number of people who call themselves Deists, but organizing Deists is like herding cats, and they show up not in churches but in secular associations promoting the Enlightenment values that so upset religious fundamentalists.

<a href="#TOC"   id="19"> Agnosticism </a>
<a class="tri" href="#20">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>The idea that the god conjecture is undecidable goes back to the scepticism of the Axial Age of Classical Greece. Yet &lsquo;agnostic&rsquo; was not coined until 1869, by T.H. Huxley, to describe his ignorance of the very things that Gnostics were so sure of. Rejecting revelation as a source of information means that we cannot know very much about the god of the Deists. At the bottom of every deep scientific probe, the real world dissolves into abstractions which are difficult to distinguish from the descriptions offered by an Eastern mystic. The known, mathematically describable hither shore of the gulf separating physical from spiritual is already incomprehensible to common sense. Since whatever gods may be necessarily reside on the far side of this gulf, there is little that can be said about them.
</p>

<p>Agnosticism is not for the faint of heart, and most people seem to prefer familiar tales to the admission of total ignorance. There is, however, one thing that we have leaned about god since Huxley&apos;s day, and that is that whatever a theist tinkering god might be able to accomplish psychologically, there is no evidence of an ability to do anything physically. Our instruments are sufficiently precise, and our records good enough, so that there is no room for anomaly or departure from the deduced laws of nature during the last century. No miracles, unless they occur by manipulation of the laws of chance in a zero-sum situation &mdash; perhaps a partisan god depriving one person of something prayed for by another. Do we <i>want</i> that sort of god?
</p>

<a href="#TOC"   id="20"> Atheism </a>
<a class="tri" href="#21">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h4>

<p>Atheists have been around since the Axial Age, with a philosopher from Melos, &lsquo;Diagoras called Atheos&rsquo;, the first to be so labelled. Atheism fits in Schleiermacher&apos;s classification as the <i>highest</i> religion, since its explanation of the universe has by far the most complex and systematic structure. It rejects the god conjecture as undecidable <i>and</i> unnecessary. Natural processes account for the universe &mdash; but not without a great deal of mental effort, and without saying anything about &lsquo;why there is something instead of nothing&rsquo; except <a class="fn">Wilczek&apos;s°<span>
	F Wilczek (1980) &lsquo;The Cosmic Asymmetry Between Matter and Anti-matter&rsquo; <cite>Scientific American</cite> Dec, 1980.
</span></a> obvious thermodynamic copout: &lsquo;The answer to the ancient question &hellip; is that <i>nothing</i> [the vacuum] is unstable.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Absent the fear of god, many people see no reason for ethics. Assuming that others have the same problem, Believers think that atheists must necessarily be immoral. <a class="fn">Sociologists°<span>
	WW Zellner (1995) <cite>Countercultures: A Sociological Analysis</cite> (St Martin&apos;s Press, NYC).
</span></a> note that the 5% of atheists in the US Bible Belt meet institutional discrimination when they come out of the closet: cars vandalized, children ostracized and beaten, threatening letters and phone calls, suggestions that they leave town, &amp;c. It may simply be that the &lsquo;moral&rsquo; majority needs someone to look down on after the Civil Rights Movement made it harder to pick on Blacks, or it may be the normal Bible-Belt/Instinct-1/chimpanzoid response to all minorities. In any case, the response shows that religion does not in any way guarantee morality. Mafia dons can be devoutly religious and viciously immoral, as can fundamentalists who believe themselves &lsquo;saved&rsquo;, inquisitors who think themselves divinely guided, and politicians who want to impose rules from the Late Neolithic.
</p>

<p>Not all atheists are paragons of ethics. Some throw out the baby of insight with the bathwater of overbelief and find all they want from life in the rewards of the alpha male. Power, sex, and money are sufficient, and they do not care how they acquire them. There are bad apples in every barrel.
</p>

<p>Just as in the interpretation of scripture, what one brings to the question determines the answer. Superficial atheism lacks a compelling justification for ethics, as a consequence of incomplete understanding, and, like the religions, has gone off half-cocked. Examples include Social Darwinism and fascism, self-serving readings of half-baked hypotheses unsupported by data. Yet if we blame colonialism on Spencer and world wars on Nietzsche, think of the support given to Arab colonialism by Islam and European colonialism by Christian missionaries, and the millions killed in the name of religion even if the underlying motivation was simple Instinct-1.

<p>Here we depart from the standard treatment, for natural religion has received little attention recently. <a class="fn">David Hume°<span>
	D Hume (1779) <cite>Dialogues concerning natural religion</cite> (Prometheus Books, Buffalo NY, 1989).
</span></a> set up the conventional straw-man god:
</p>

<blockquote> What truth is so obvious, so certain, as that there exists a God? People in the most ignorant ages have believed this, and the most refined geniuses have worked to produce new proofs and arguments for it. And what truth is so important as this? It is the ground of all our hopes, the surest foundation of morality, the firmest support of society, and the only principle that ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations.
</blockquote>

<p class="flu">only to demolish it with an anticipation of Popperian failure of falsification.
</p>

<p>Natural religion might today be called agnostic panendeism (as in <a href="../_A/A00.shtml#F0.1">Fig. 0.1</a>) or Gaia (as in the front <a href="../_A/A-1.shtml#EP1">endpaper</a>) or planetary ecology. By whatever name, this as yet unsynthesized view seems to be where perceptive science is taking us.
</p>

<p>Today we have the powers once attributed to the gods, but we tend to exercize those powers with the mentality of a locust plague. To earth scientists, biologists, thermodynamicists, ecologists, and anyone paying attention, this approach is demonstrably failing. Even when wisdom is available, <i>effective</i> governance is administered with short-term priorities.
</p>

<p>The misbelief that science and economics should be ethically empty is largely responsible for our poor performance. In fact, the naturalistic world view offers 2 internal sources of ethics, usually unrecognized and always underutilized.
</p>

<p>The first natural source of ethics is that evolution provides a clear guide to pragmatic ethics. The trend is toward increasing complexity, followed by emergence of unexpected phenomena (<a href="../_F/F24.shtml#27">Ch. 24)</a>.
The results look as though evolution had a pair of teleological goals:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual <b>uniqueness</b>, of both genes and ideas;</li>
<li>Steadily increasing community complexity and <b>interdependence</b>, from stromatolites in the Pre-Cambrian to today&apos;s poorly understood relation of a complex economy on its delicate (and highly stressed) natural base.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flu">The tel increased viability offered by uniqueness and interdependence, and if one needs to attribute that to divine guidance, then we have <a class="fn">McFague&apos;s°<span>
	S McFague (1992) &lsquo;A square in the quilt: One theologian&apos;s contribution to the planetary agenda&rsquo; in SC Rockefeller, JC Elder (eds) <cite>Spirit and Nature</cite> (Beacon, Boston): 39-58.
</span></a> god who is &lsquo;in and part of the evolutionary process&rsquo;. &lsquo;Evolutionary ethics&rsquo; takes the apparent teleological drive behind these developments as a practical suggestion of what to strive for.
</p>

<p> The second natural source of ethics comes from science, which &mdash; as our most reliably self-correcting enterprise &mdash; has the means to <i>discover</i> ethics. Perhaps its most relevant finding is that Instinct-2 has evolved as
</p>

<blockquote>a predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish those who violate the norms of cooperation, at personal cost, even when it is implausible to expect that these costs will be repaid either by others or at a later date. &mdash; <a class="fn">H. Gintis°<span>

	RB Textor (1967) <cite>A Cross-Cultural Sample</cite> (HRAF Press, New Haven CT).
</span></a> did this pairwise for 400 cultures chosen to be representative of the world, and 536 characteristics (hence the 3000 pages of his <cite>Standard Cross-Cultural Survey</cite>, mainly computer print out). He discarded all pairs that were not statistically significant, and gave numerical indications of the strength of the correlation. One might expect that this would simplify the verification of ethnological hypotheses, but this is not always the case. One often needs to examine groups of characteristics, selected to represent some higher-level construct that one is interested in.
</p>

<p>An example may help. Table 6.2 includes everything coded about &lsquo;religion&rsquo;. Consider line FC &lsquo;Finished Characteristic&rsquo; 426: &lsquo;High god is present&rsquo;. The codes are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A &lsquo;A high god present but otiose or not concerned with human affairs&rsquo;, 69 cultures;
</li>

<li>B &lsquo;A high god present and active in human affairs but not offering positive support to human morality&rsquo;, 26 cultures;
</li>

<li>C &lsquo;A high god present, active, and specifically supportive of human morality&rsquo;, 61 cultures. A, B, and C are combined into the 156 of Column <i>Yes</i>;
</li>

<li>O &lsquo;A high god absent or not reported in substantial descriptions of religious beliefs&rsquo;, 104 cultures in Column <i>No</i>.</li>

<li>Column <i>?</i> is &lsquo;No Data&rsquo;, with 140 cultures.</li>

<li>Column <i>X</i> is &lsquo;Irrelevant&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves 140 cultures unrepresented for FC 428, either because informants never mentioned their gods, or because the right questions were not asked. The implicit statistical assumption is that these cultures would divide in the same ratio as the ones that provided the Yes and No answers. Among &lsquo;hard&rsquo; scientists, such data would be considered suspect. The meaning of the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; columns is not under control of the analyst. He cannot refine the questions, nor change the coding. (He does have the option of coding new characteristics by reading the literature, but this is a daunting challenge.) Nevertheless, this is what we have to work with. The years of intense intellectual effort involved in reading, evaluating, and encoding the original reports means that those involved may tend to overestimate the statistical reliability of conclusions drawn from the data. The natural response is to take conclusions that are contrary to one&apos;s predilections with a grain of salt &mdash; while enthusiastically accepting the ones you like. <i>Caveat lector!</i>
</p>

<p>Perhaps more important is FC 428, gods with an interest in morality, of which there are only 61/400, or 15%. This casts considerable doubt on the commonly voiced idea that &lsquo;all cultures have [useful] religions&rsquo;.

<p>FCs 453 to 456 reflect David McClelland&apos;s interest in &lsquo;the need to achieve&rsquo;, and you are referred to <cite>The Achieving Society</cite> (1961, pp 488-489) for interpretation of his coding. FCs 426-433 and 436 were coded by Guy Swanson (as explained in <cite>The Birth of the Gods</cite>), for 50 representative societies from 144 field studies. Swanson&apos;s initial question was &lsquo;from what experiences do the ideas of the supernatural and its myriad forms arise?&rsquo;. Finding this too broad to answer, he settled for asking about 7 of the myriad aspects: monotheism, polytheism, ancestral spirits, reincarnation, the soul, witchcraft, and the supernatural and morality. He divided &lsquo;the supernatural&rsquo; into 2 categories because these are the only ones accessible through the field work:
</p>

<p>&bull; <b>mana</b> &mdash; &lsquo;a substance or essence which gives one the ability to perform tasks or achieve ends which are otherwise impossible&rsquo;, and
</p>

<p>&bull; <b>spirits</b> &mdash; &lsquo;organized clusters of purpose having personal identities and access to <i>mana</i>, possibly immortal, generally invisible, and limited only by other spirits&rsquo;.
</p>

<p><b>He could then discard a number of full-fledged theories of religion, including:</b>
</p>


<ul class="ul2">
<li>The Tylor&ndash;Lang animism-polytheism-monotheism progression;</li>
<li>Sumner &amp; Keller&apos;s ghost-fear and chance;</li>
<li>Freud&apos;s Œdipal handwaving;</li>
<li>The social integration of John Dewey and George Mead;</li>
<li>Religion as compensation for deprivation;</li>
<li>The identification of gods with natural forces;</li>
<li>Monotheistic gods as projections of fathers; and</li>
<li>Spirits as personification of chance.</li>
</ul>


<p>Swanson could not reject Durkheim&apos;s notion of sacred and profane, or Tylor&apos;s &lsquo;spirits are personified causes&rsquo;, and as noted <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#03">above</a>, he discovered the workings of bicamerality without sorting out the underlying behavior of the brain.
</p>

<p>The major difficulty of this approach is using it to answer questions which were not asked. Perhaps an ethnographer could mine this data for the presence of bicamerality &mdash; but one can wish that the idea had been current in 1840!

<a class="tri" href="#25">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>We can avoid many of Guthrie&apos;s difficulties in formulating a theory of religion if we limit ourselves to considering what religion was originally, rather than what it has become. Just as Paul prided himself on being all things to all men, he &mdash; and a thousand others &mdash; tailored their sales pitch to their congregations. The results today are bound to be a bit various and difficult to classify. Consequently, as mentioned in the Preface, I prefer a &lsquo;paleofunctional&rsquo; hypothesis that gets to the heart of the matter:
</p>

<table  class="t2"><tbody>
<tr><td>Religion is the synthetic kinship, invented bicamerally, that got us out of the Middle Paleolithic and out of the animal kingdom, and turned us into time-binding humans.
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>&rsquo;Bicameral&rsquo; reminds us that religion stems from preconscious days. When our gods spoke to us directly from the right hemisphere, there was no doubt of their reality and authority, and we obeyed them willy-nilly. &lsquo;Synthetic kinship&rsquo; reminds us that the purpose of religion was to keep us from killing eachother, using the only argument that we were capable of understanding at the time. &lsquo;Middle Paleolithic&rsquo; recalls the 160,000 years of rather pointless existence before we thought of this idea, when our only way of dealing with strangers was to kill them.  The definition in the Preface added a clause about events in the Neolithic, which we will take up in its <a href="../_C/C09.shtml">proper place</a>, when we found that there was a price to pay for leaving the Middle Paleolithic.
</p>

<p>Comparison of the above definition with <a href="#T6.2">Table 6.2</a> reveals little overlap, but there might be enough data in the HRAF files to falsify the boxed
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt=”Research”></a>
hypothesis above. I currently have no way of doing this, so I invite any ThD candidate who wants to falsify my hypothesis to shoot it down. If no one succeeds by the time I am looking for another project, I will see if I can afford access to HRAF and learn how to use the files. The probability of meaningful results is low, simply because statistical traces of interactions 30,000 years ago will be weak.

<p class="epi">______ [Insert name of god] was invented only to keep women and children in order. &mdash; Generalization of Lang&apos;s description of Twanyirika, deity of the Aruntas.
</p>

<p>Appendix 6a epitomizes ca 200 of the more significant theories of religion. Many are opinions maintained before anyone thought religion needed a theoretical basis, but sometimes a dogma says a great deal about the unvoiced theory behind it. Increasing awareness that religion needs explaining has resulted in a steady stream of recent books.
</p>

<p>19th-century theorists gave sweeping answers to large questions, going well beyond what their data would support. To these authors, &lsquo;evolutionary theology&rsquo; meant the upward sequence from animism to totemism to classical religions to the perfection of Christianity.
</p>

<p>Critics attacked the method of reaching conclusions by comparing unlike cultures. Later workers, following Evans-Pritchard, studied a single culture in intimate detail to describe how <i>its</i> religion worked. We were left with an unsatisfactory polarization: enthusiastic generalizations drawn with a broad brush on the one hand; detailed sociology that may not apply to other cultures on the other.
</p>

<p>Unlike religions themselves, theories of religion are not mutually exclusive. The worst that can be said of any entry in the Appendix is that it is incomplete. The ultimate theory must either take them all into account, or show why they can be set aside.
</p>

<p>The first &lsquo;instrument-of-god&rsquo; theory is by far the most popular. It is offered by the prophets themselves, as their best subjective description, and accepted by the majority of people as perfectly natural. The practice is not obsolete despite its antiquity, for (although the story was routinely denied by the White House) during his 2004 campaign, George W. Bush reportedly told Amish farmers, &lsquo;I trust God speaks <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/voice-of-god-revealed-to-be-cheney-on-intercom-1851" class="fk">through me°.&rsquo;<span>
	And &lsquo;to me.&rsquo; <cite>The Onion</cite> reports that Bush was convinced that Cheney, speaking over the White House intercom, was the voice of god. &lsquo;I&apos;m driven with a mission from God. God would tell me: <q>George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan</q>. And I did, and then God would tell me: <q>George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq</q>, and I did.&rsquo; said Bush in June 2003.<br>
	Cheney&apos;s vacation during Hurricane Katrina apparently explains the failure of White House action: &lsquo;Bill Kristol said <q>The president told me that he was praying every day in his office, but had received no reply. I had no idea what he meant, but of course, it all makes sense now.</q>&rsquo; [Click for more.]
</span></a>< [See <a href="../_A/A02.shtml#F2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>]
</p>

<p>The second entry, attributed to domestic cats (who take it very seriously), was also entertained by certain Roman emperors. Nor is it entirely missing from recent US foreign policy. It is the logical conjunction of &lsquo;power corrupts&rsquo; and the concept of a &lsquo;personal&rsquo; god.
</p>

<p>Aristotle I is a historical view reported by Aristotle, to which we will return. Aristotle II is his own interpretation &mdash; and one not bettered for 2 millennia, for here follows a 2000-year-long hiatus in which religion was the explanans rather than the explanandum.
</p>

<p>Eruigena (&lsquo;born in Ireland&rsquo;), whose books were burned by his contemporaries, is notable because his work can be seen as an anticipation of the &lsquo;world-line&rsquo; of special relativity. A world-line tracks passage through 4-dimensional space time. In Eruigena&apos;s view, the collective <a class="fn">world-line°<span>
	Such a collection, which tracks not a simple spatial point, but a complex spatial volume, through space-time, is today called a &lsquo;brane&rsquo;, and takes us into the perplexing world of M-theory, which needs not just 4 dimensions, but 11.
</span></a> begins with god-as-origin, progresses through the Platonic and then the &lsquo;real&rsquo; worlds, and returns to god-as-goal. Like today&apos;s <a href="http://damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/qg_ss.html">M-theory</a>, this idea is large enough to encompass many other theories.
</p>

<p>Spinoza, at least a century before his time, is the first since Aristotle to consider the nature of religion rather than the nature of god. He made a sharp break with medieval theologians to produce a theory which meshes with scientific thought today. He tried to create a religion which people could believe without harm and philosophers could debate without rancor. Being logical and not packaged as a revelation, it was not a success.
</p>

<p>Next comes the outbreak of intellectual curiosity, scepticism, and clear thinking we call the Enlightenment. Most contemporary ideas found expression during this period.
</p>

<p>Hume&apos;s &lsquo;extended sentiment of humanity&rsquo; is a &lsquo;supra-tribal mythos&rsquo; functionally synonymous with altruism. Accepted in his day as an instinct, it did not initially need the explanation later provided by Robert Trivers. Leave all the scriptures behind, but take <cite>Dialogues concerning Natural Religion</cite> on any colonizing venture to a new planet.
</p>

<p>It may be that despite Jacobi&apos;s claim, not everyone can now have a &lsquo;<a class="fn">religious experience°&rsquo;,<span>
	Surprisingly, 50% of the population reports at least one religious experience even today.
</span></a> since we no longer encourage the ability. Perhaps in Jacobi&apos;s world, there was no source of ethical guidance to replace religion. Jacobi&apos;s error is common because a religious experience <i>feels</i> externally driven. It always seems to the recipient that he is uniquely blest and has finally got the story straight.
</p>

<p>Volney returns to Aristotle&apos;s idea about the astronomical origin of religion. He is aware of the human tendency to see meaningful patterns in random configurations, and introduces the modern idea that the only meaningful aspect of religion is its effect on behavior.
</p>

<p>Schleiermacher&apos;s principle concern was defending religion from the Enlightenment and the cold transcendence of Deism, while rejecting the traditional Christian mythos. He appears to be the first to introduce &lsquo;instinct&rsquo; in defense of religion, seizing the universal feeling of dependence upon something greater than mankind as proof that religion was as important to man as reason.
</p>

<p>Some of &lsquo;my&rsquo; central ideas seem to have been first clearly enunciated by Auguste Comte, whose work I met directly only in research for this Appendix. Early on, he suggested a law of progress in which each branch of knowledge passes through 3 theoretical stages: the Theological or Fictitious, in which the search for first causes attributes all phenomena to supernatural beings; the Metaphysical or Abstract, in which phenomena are produces by personified abstract forces; and the Scientific or Positive, which gives up absolutes, origins, and teleology in favor of a search for laws in the relations of succession and resemblance. He also emphasized the role of religion in making possible larger associations than the family. In later life, religion&apos;s ability to control selfishness led him to style himself the High Priest of Humanity, promoting a positivist doctrine with Love as its Principle, Order as its Basis, and Progress as its Aim.
</p>

<p>Feuerbach seems to have been the first to notice how many religious ideas put the cart before the horse. Marx echoes Aristotle on the abuse of religion for political ends, adding that it is a poor idea to attribute our best qualities to god when we should be nurturing them in ourselves.
</p>

<p>Tylor anticipated Müller with an anthropological study of religion which identified dreams as the source of soul-body dualism.
</p>

<p>Max Müller (1823-1900) has been called the greatest of the Indologists. He legitimized the study of religion. His linguistic theory, shallow though it seems, deals adequately with many of the gods in Hesiod&apos;s <cite>Theogony</cite>.
</p>

<p>James and Freud showed the importance of the unconscious in matters religious.
</p>

<p>Durkeim saw the roots of religion in the superexcitation of tribal gatherings and the attribution of this infectious <i>mana</i> to the tribal totem: these were basically <i>family</i> gatherings.
</p>

<p>Éliade&apos;s version of the sacred is the logical offspring of Durkheim and Persinger.
</p>

<p>Tillich&apos;s paradoxical words were written 4 years apart. In the first he was dismissing the god of theism, for &lsquo;no criticism [of God as a being who intervenes in history] can be sharp enough&rsquo;. In the second, he was seeking common ground with <a class="fn">Einstein°,<span>
	A Einstein (1941) <cite>Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium</cite> (Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., NYC).
</span></a> who had spoken of &lsquo;the grandeur of reason &hellip; incarnate in existence &hellip; inaccessible to man&rsquo;. Tillich also made many insightful and less paradoxical observations.
</p>

<p>Jaynes I take as contributing essential components, without which no theory of religion can be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>Guthrie may have been the first to suggest a survival advantage, a critical aspect which most theoreticians ignore.
</p>

<p>J. Willard Gibbs almost singlehandedly completed thermodynamics. Pareto, trained as an engineer, aspired to do for sociology what Gibbs had done for thermodynamics. When he looked at where this led him, he suggested that his book should not be widely read, lest it disrupt society &mdash; but he needn&apos;t have worried. Society is impervious to logic.

Hegel&apos;s &lsquo;GOD is unity abiding absolutely in itself&rsquo; sounds profound, yet it imparts neither information nor inclination to delve deeper. (I might understand this better if it were an attempt to define <a class="fn">the number 1°.)<span>
	Even straightforward concepts can be complicated by those so inclined. An &lsquo;abbreviated structuralist definition of the number 1&rsquo; contained in the 1956 edition of Bourbaki&apos;s <cite>La Théorie des Ensembles</cite> would contain 4,523,659,424,929 terms if its symbolic formulation were expanded.

</span></a> Postmodern material has a similar lack of effect. I ignore Derrida, Foucault, Lacan and their ilk because I would be unable to detect a central idea in their writing if they had one.

</span></a>
</p>

<p>The sheer variety of approaches in the Appendix supports the absence of an accepted definition of religion. A satisfactory theory should answer a number of questions. Among these are 7 central topics, some of which we have already touched on:
</p>

<ol style="font-weight: 700;">
  <li>What is the nature of religious experience?</li>
  <li>Whence come the gods?</li>
  <li>Why does every advanced culture have a religion?</li>
  <li>Why is the condition of belief, rather than the content, the source of religious boons?</li>
  <li>Why is religious belief universally untestable?</li>
  <li>Why is pothodoxy so often overwhelming?</li>
  <li>What viability advantage did religion bring?</li>
</ol>


<p>We will try to answer these over the next 6 chapters.
</p>

<p>No prior approach asks all of these questions. Believers accept gods as <i>explicantia</i> rather than as <i>explicanda</i>; anthropologists and sociologists discuss the functions that religion serves in particular societies; theologians and psychologists do not mention viability. Few address the sheer necessity of belief.
</p>

<p>A number of theories of religion &mdash; Marx&apos;s class opiate, Weber&apos;s theodicy, Parson&apos;s social order &mdash; assume far more infrastructure than was available early on. Religion as we know it, created by farmers and herders, is a development of the last 0.25% of the human experience; religion studied in Neolithic tribes represents at most 2% of this period. These samples bear little relation to the religion that originated in the Eurasian Paleolithic, which has to be something that made sense to &mdash; and changed the behavior of &mdash; talking chimpanzees.
</p>

<p>A structured view of religious theory suggests a layered approach. The bottom layer is the more or less universal animism that populates the earth with invisible beings, probably continuous with the limbic response of a horse spooked by a blowing newspaper. Bicamerality gave voices to this layer, and some measure of unconscious control and direction, of which Hamurabi took full advantage. The third layer was the poetically constructed theisms, poly- and mono-, that took us up to the Axial Age. Then Gautama and others made it clear that the earlier stages had been crutches, helpful before we developed our own ethical sense, but obstructive and distracting when our society had healthy bones of rational understanding.

<p>Reviewer <a class="fn">Daniel Yee°<span>
	D Yee (1997) Review of Stewart Guthrie&apos;s <cite>Faces In The Clouds</cite> http://dannyreviews.com/.
</span></a> voiced a different sort of complaint:
</p>

<blockquote>There has been relatively little new work on theory of religion in recent decades: there seems to have been a general acceptance that the subject is too hard, that the existing theoretical morass is undrainable.
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this defeatist conclusion is the result of not looking far enough into the past, and so omitting the essential discipline of evolutionary biology from theories of religion.
</p>

<p>There is one more aspect that prior theories of religion have omitted. In productive disciplines, theory and practice interact with constant feedback. Experiment suggests revisions to theory; theory suggests novel experiments. The concept of experimental religion is anathema to religious leaders (with the notable exception of the Dalai Lama), apparently so threatening to their world view that it is dismissed as impious, impossible to do and irrelevant when performed. Consequently feedback is still absent from religious studies, which in turn denies its results to theorists of religion. While religion has continued on its traditional path, one of its existential questions has been answered by other disciplines entirely. This brings us to the theory intimated in the first end paper, and described more fully below.

The Standard Model of physics, presenting the building blocks of matter. All entries are in some sense particles. The leftmost column of light fermions is what <a class="fn">we are made of°.<span>
	For lovers of mnemonics, the world was created &lsquo;NUDE&rsquo;: Neutrino ν, Up quark u, Down quark d, Electron e. This is the mud the Potter used, after its half-billion-year evolution into more complex forms of protons, neutrons, atoms, stars, molecules, and planets.
</span></a> The 4 bosons carry 3 of the 4 forces (gravity still being absent from <a class="fn">the model°).<span>

Only the photon (γ) and electron (e) interact with us directly; g, W, and Z hold atomic nuclei together.

(It opens with a figure very like this one with more information, but by the time you have enlarged its numbers to readability, they are pixelated.)
</figcaption></figure>


<p>A more prosaic approach finds its challenge in the commonplace world itself. Beginning with the Aegean attempts to find <i>principles</i> rather than <i>principals</i> controlling the world, and continuing with the astronomers, Newton, and the scientific method, it eventually led to the Standard Model of Fig 6.2. This has, indeed, uncovered phenomena different in essence from the commonplace things we understand. That the phenomena are not quite what supernaturalists were expecting is a typical result of exploration. This approach &mdash; with equivalent input from many other disciplines &mdash; has satisfactorily answered the primary existential question: &lsquo;Where did we come from?&rsquo;. It is relevant to our theme that the discovery of the Standard Model was informed by symmetry theorems of mathematical physics.
</p>

<p>The answer shows that we had been looking in the wrong place, misled by experiences that made particular areas of research easy of access (but unproductive of results). This is the logical fallacy of <i>lux facilis</i>, searching for lost car keys beneath the streetlight. Everyday logic took us down to the concept of atoms, one level above the standard model. Moving beyond that had to wait for the Renaissance, electricity, vacuums, and high technology.
</p>

<p>The simplicity of the grid of Fig. 6.2 is deceptive. The quarks, <b>u</b> up and <b>d</b> down, <b>c</b> charmed and <b>s</b> strange, <b>t</b> top and <b>b</b> bottom), are held together in pairs (mesons) or triples (baryons: neutron <b>udd</b> and proton <b>uud</b>) by gluons <b>g</b>, of which there are 12 varieties. Only the light generation form stable objects: the others fleetingly inhabit high-energy regimes. The ancient alchemists anticipated the day when we will manipulate gluons as easily as we now manipulate photons and electrons.
</p>

<p>Note that electrical charge (upper right corner of the boxes) is orderly, while the mass (bottom) seem arbitrary. The completed model is expected to explain the masses in an elegant manner. Under the tiles labelled &lsquo;e&rsquo; and &lsquo;γ&rsquo; lies everything we know about electric motors and generators, magnets, optics, computers, radar, gamma rays, X-rays, spectroscopy, radiant heating, antenna theory, neon lights, LEDs, Josephson junctions, &amp;c, &amp;c. Admittedly, these are the most familiar and accessible tiles. Their wealth of practical applications are the result of 2 centuries of hard work.
</p>

<p>We know less about the other tiles, although they represent the life work of a covey of little-known geniuses. The bailiwick of the other bosons is the atomic nucleus, which we do not yet know how to manipulate (except in the crudest manner), so we don&apos;t know what can be done with them, but one wonders about the possibilities of elemental transmutation, nuclear fusion, and similar alchemical dreams.
</p>

<p>The Standard Model&apos;s neatness is deceptive in another way. The Higgs boson (missing from Fig. 6.2) has been found, and is expected to explain the peculiar masses of the fermions. Still undetected is the graviton, which might explain how gravity works. The Model says nothing about &lsquo;dark energy&rsquo;, a 5th force that drives the accelerating expansion of the universe, nor about &lsquo;dark matter&rsquo;, thought to be needed to keep the universe &lsquo;flat&rsquo; and explain rotational aspects of galaxies (although MOND, the <a class="fk" href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.70.083509">MOdified Newtonian Dynamics°<span>
	MOND adds small corrections to Newton&apos;s <i>f=ma</i> on the scale of galaxies. They are too small to be dectectable within the solar system.
</span></a> of Mordecai Milgrom works at least as well as dark matter without messing up the Stanrd model).
</p>

<p>For 25 years, the incomplete Standard Model has not failed (nor has any indication of the anticipated supersymmetric version yet appeared). What we currently understand takes us back to the origin of the universe, and step by step organizes it into its current form, without requiring anything more. Establish the rules and initial conditions, and all else follows, much as the analysts of the Enlightenment imagined would happen. We do not get the sterile clockwork universe in which everything is preordained that made early Deism unrealistic, but one filled with randomness, turbulence, friction, chaos, and &mdash; surprisingly, rules which use these very qualities to generate startling emergences. The rules turn out to be imbued with subtlety, so that simple beginnings lead to complex results &mdash; but always in a natural way, understandable after the event, although not predictable before.

<p>Figure 6.2 does not say much to anyone but a particle physicist, yet if you look again at the front end papers you will see that it is a major part of what the student goddesses sought: a set of &lsquo;laws and conditions that will produce a universe in which social justice prevails&rsquo;. Having said that, there are several cautions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Our grasp of the gods&apos; share of this task &mdash; as encapsulated in the Standard Model &mdash; is incomplete. All indications are that extension will involve new theories and new particles, rather than anything currently classed as &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo;.

<li>We humans are proof that the students are on the right track, in that their universe can generate both the concept of social justice, and autonomous <a class="fn">moral entities°.<span>
	This claim is somewhat damped by the preference of a majority of the human race, which seems happiest when engaged in mindless ritual, and wants nothing to do with moral autonomy.
</span></a> This is a giant step forward, because many plausible universes will not generate stars, let alone life. The difficulty of implementing the concept after discovering it is shown by the intense intellectual effort we devote to <b>finding theories to justify the implementations of moral <i>injustice</i></b> &mdash; among them:
</li>

<ul><b>
<li>the caste system,</li>
<li>the divine right of kings,</li>
<li>&lsquo;trickle-down economics&rsquo;,</li>
<li>male dominance,</li>
<li>corporate personhood, and</li>
<li>the unrelenting efforts of the 1&permil; to legalize their right to 100% of the wealth.</li>
</b></ul>

<li>Our failure to do our part &mdash; to devise a workable system of social justice, which was never going to pop up by itself! &mdash; may not doom the entire experiment to the sink drain, but it will doom our share in it to extinction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our concept of morality was enunciated at least by the time of the philosophers and prophets of the Axial Age. The modern discipline of moral psychology (that tries to explain where this idea comes from) was not established until <a class="fn">Kohlberg°<span>

	C Gilligan (1982) <cite>In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women&apos;s Development</cite> (Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA).
</span></a> put forth explanatory theories, based on Piagetian development of a sense of fairness in childhood (justice-based), and an extension of maternal responsibilities (care-based), respectively. These were synthesized into the Eirenic view that social justice is about protecting individuals. To this anthropocentric approach we must today add the Gaian concerns for our environmental support systems and their sustainability (if only as a matter of our own survival). But this still leaves conservatives (primarily distinguished from liberals by their lesser concern for others) in the outer darkness. It was left to <a class="fn"> Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham°<span>

The Structure of Moral Justice. While all 5 branches of ethics in the middle row are recognied by both conservatives and liberals, conservatives show less concern for others (yellow boxes), and have a suite of concerns largely driven by attachment to a pothodox outlook with a hierarchical concept of <i>community</i>, and prefer social regulation of the red boxes. Liberals have a much wider interpretation of <i>community</i>, and see the red boxes as matters of personal choice and courtesy to others, rather than moral imperatives. Concern about the environment and sustainability is a moral foundation among the liberals that I know. If society were serious about survival, such concern would be widespread and easily detectable by social scientists.

<p class="flu">This helps explain such oddities as the about face of Republicans who accurately asessed Donald Trump as a charlatan and narcissist
during the primary campaign, but nevertheless followed him abjectly into arguably treasonous behavior as President. Oddly, this trait &mdash; destrutive as it has been in recent decades &mdash; speaks to a long and precarious period when good leadership was a survival advantage. It may be that bicamerality, in addition to its defining access to unconsciously organized information, also used brain volume more efficiently. This would produce an appreciable IQ jump, with leadership potential of the sort that made the later Moses and Hamurabi memorable.

<p>The incomplete answers we have found should be fed back to improve the practice of religion. (Gautama, Zoroaster, Augustine, and the Dalai Lama all advocated this approach, so it is not exactly a new idea.) If it is not clear how to go about this, it is because lesser religious leaders have spent 2500 years denying the need, sure that an omnipotent god is benevolent and needs no help. It seems to me that this is a place where &lsquo;religious studies&rsquo; have an opportunity to become relevant. Religion itself may be committed to maintaining tradition, but the philosophical study of religion is able to discuss the failings of this approach. One place to begin (for instance) is by disabusing the current &lsquo;elites&rsquo; of the notions which support their fantasies. They are not the most important part of the universe, nor is some god rewarding them for their virtue. Some hold their position by tyranny, some by virtue of unethical laws which support their illusions. We do not matter <i>at all</i> to the universe until we produce and maintain an ethical civilization. We begin by changing the laws of our society.
</p>

<p>Is that too abstract a description? Here is one simple, practical, and eminently fair example: Let us examine the distribution of income in our society, and carve it into quintiles. The mean of the lowest quintile &mdash; the average income of the poorest-paid 20% of the population &mdash; we denote <i>Q</i> ($11,240 in 2011). Now, if we are serious about the Constitution&apos;s purpose of &lsquo;promoting the general Welfare&rsquo;, we link the pay of our lawmakers to their performance, by making it some small multiple of <i>Q</i>.
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif" alt="New-idea"></a>

<p>The Standard Model scarcely begins to answer the things we wonder about. Looking toward the past, we raise the intellectual questions: Why <i>these</i> &lsquo;laws and conditions&rsquo;? What is in the textbook used by the student goddesses? What results are produced by other sets of &lsquo;laws and conditions&rsquo;? Why does even the relatively straightforward Fig. 6.2 conceal immense and subtle mathematical sophistication?

<p>Looking toward the future, we find even more important questions: Why is it so difficult for self-conscious intelligences to produce an ethical society? (Many small-scale societies do better than the New Deal, which seems to have been one of our better large-scale approaches.) Why, when we show signs of approaching one, do we so willingly cooperate with those who want to destroy it?

<p>One answer seems to be a nearly universal &lsquo;Expletive! I&apos;m alright, Jack!&rsquo; response. This is characteristic of  those recently elevated (by social action) out of the often desperate straits of the lower class, when they discover that they are now expected to pay taxes to help lift others. This is exacerbated in the US by the Horatio Alger/Ayn Rand mythos that attributes all progress &mdash; whether social or personal &mdash; to the hard-working individual, while overlooking the social infrastructure that has made <i>any</i> progress possible.
