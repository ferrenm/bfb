<p>The question of the existence of god is undecidable, or it would have been convincingly decided by now. However, some things <i>can</i> be said with certainty. Among them: if there be gods, they and their behavior are unlike the descriptions by prophets. As I may have mentioned, my suggestion is that gods are more like equations than anything else in human experience, for equations have the godlike qualities of <a class="fn">omnipotence°,<span>
	Predictably, a Muslim reader objected: &lsquo;Only Allah is omnipotent. Equations have limited applications.&rsquo;. Until we discover the Theory of Everything, our equations are more like a pantheon. Maxwell&apos;s Equations, describing the behavior of the electromagnetic (EM) field, work throughout the universe, and cannot be circumvented. If the EM field is zero, the equations still apply. The solution to a quadratic (by all accounts a lesser equation than Maxwell&apos;s) may have less to do, but it works everywhere, it knows all there is to know about its job, and it always provides the correct answers.
</span></a> omniscience, and omnipresence, and in the manner of the deist gods, they are simultaneously immensely helpful and unaware of our existence.
</p>

<p>Let us frame a simple proposition,
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im"
		src="../Images/K-NewIdea3.gif"
		alt="NewIdea"></a>
supported equally by psychology and observation:
</p>

<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
When society needs gods, they are present and obvious;<br>
when society no longer needs gods, they vanish.
</div>

<p>When we were bicameral, gods were conspicuous. With the development of consciousness c. 1200 BCE, gods began to depart, having served their purpose. The problem was, <i>society</i> might no longer need gods, but thanks to Neolithic pothodoxy, most <i>people</i> still did, and like kittens being weaned, we did not take this loss of support gracefully. Theist gods claim consistency: those of Sumer had served all Mesopotamia with only a change of name; &lsquo;For I am YHVH, I change not&rsquo; {Malachi 3:6}; and &lsquo;the same yesterday, and today, and forever&rsquo; {Heb 13:8}. The disappearance of the gods then meant either theism&apos;s consistency claim was wrong, or gods lie to us, or the god conjecture itself was wrong. Pothodoxy made us keep the god conjecture and explain away inconsistency. We are still doing this 3 millennia later. This seems excessive, so it is fair to ask, why is it so difficult to take advantage of an adult operating system, and move on?
</p>

<p><a class="fn">Gregory Paul°<span>
	G Paul (2009) &lsquo;The Chronic Dependence of Popular Religiosity upon Dysfunctional Psychosociological Conditions&rsquo; <cite>Evolutionary Psychology</cite> <b>7</b>(#3): 398-441.
</span></a> explains the persistence of theism as a function of social policy:
</p>

<blockquote>The nonuniversality of strong religious devotion, and the ease with which large populations abandon serious theism when conditions are sufficiently benign, refute hypotheses that religious belief and practice are the normal, deeply set human mental state, whether they are superficial or natural in nature. Instead, <b>popular religion is usually a superficial and flexible psychological mechanism for coping with the high levels of stress and anxiety produced by sufficiently dysfunctional social and especially economic environments</b>. Popular nontheism is a similarly casual response to superior conditions. &mdash; (Emphasis added.)
</blockquote>

by empowering racism on the one hand and inequality on the other

<p>This would explain the logical puzzle of Evangelical support for feudofascist policies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              



association between ‘Making America Grate’ with feudofascist policy and a resurgent quasi-Christian evangelism.




(This need not have been intentional: the 3rd-millenium Republicans are noted less for introspection and analysis than for gut feelings and prayer.) But it might be that the indirect result of antisocial legislation is sufficient stress and anxiety for <i>hoi polloi</i> to turn instinctively to limbic worship of a demagog who promises relief from ‘rampant government interference’ &mdash; even though his behavior is antithetical to the Sermon on the Mount!
</p>

<p>Despite Jaynes&apos;s and Paul&apos;s pragmatic explanations, arguments about religion have historically made much of <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i> knowledge. <i>A posteriori</i> (human, rational) knowledge arises from experience, and is never absolute, because it can always be increased by future experience. <i>A priori</i> (divine, revealed) knowledge is an axiomatic basis that we assume, and thus &lsquo;logically prior to experience&rsquo;, without which no progress can be made. (Customary examples are the rules of logic or Euclid&apos;s postulates.) Priesthoods insist that knowledge of god can only be had from their particular <i>a priori</i> revelations.
</p>

<p>The rebuttal is the jewel of the Enlightenment: <b>Revealed religions are arbitrary.</b> This idea immediately puts one at odds with 90% of the world (who nevertheless can see this clearly of religions not their own). It is seldom worth arguing with them, for until they are ready, debate merely <a href="../_A/A01.shtml#13">reinforces their position</a>. When they are ready, they will think of it themselves. As an example of arbitrary &lsquo;revelation&rsquo;, the Excluded Middle (<i>x</i> cannot be both <b>A</b> and <b>not-A</b>) is<i> </i>axiomatic in Aristotelian logic, where it is understood as <i>a posteriori</i>, firmly based in experience. Nevertheless, it was pragmatically rejected in India by Samkara (c. 800 CE) in aid of brahmanic creation of <i>a priori </i>mythology to control newly assimilated tribal cultures, with the unfortunate result of leaving an &lsquo;ability to swallow logical contradictions wholesale [&hellip; in] the Indian <a class="fn">national character&rsquo;°.<span>
	DD Kosambi (1965) <cite>The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline </cite>(Routledge & Kegan Paul, London): 7.1.
</span></a>
</p>

<p>Theism claims that the only thing about god that can be established by human reason is that god exists. My problem in presenting the medieval arguments for the existence of god is that I find the axioms and postulates of theistic reasoning incompatible with logic. I will do the best I can, but I give fair warning that I cannot read, with any comprehension, <a class="fn">Leibniz&apos;s°<span>
	GW Leibniz (1710) <cite>Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l‘homme et l‘origine du mal</cite> (Isaac Troye, Amsterdam).
</span></a> <i>Theodicy</i>, which in clear and luminous language defends the theistic arguments of the early 18th century. I cannot evaluate the consistency of his response to Pierre Bayle (whose propositions he sets out fully and fairly). This an intellectual failing, because as Cicero explained, a philosopher should be able to defend both sides of an argument persuasively before he tries to explain it to anyone. It is a level of abstraction too far to say &lsquo;<i>If</i> I believed A, and L (who does) asserts that B and C imply D, would I agree with L?&rsquo; The implications of believing A on B require separate and detailed consideration, as do the implication of believing A on C. Next we must consider the interactions of the revised view of B and C &mdash; and where was I? We don&apos;t have room for the details, and it is just a whole lot easier to say &lsquo;Not-A, therefore not-L&rsquo;. With that cautionary introduction, we look at some of the more interesting approaches.

<p>I refer the reader to Wikipedia for adequate discussions of 18 of the standard arguments for the existence of god under the headings:  Beauty, Christological, Consciousness, Cosmological, Degree, Desire, Exorcisms, Experience, Love, Miracles, Morality, Near-death experiences, Ontological, Pascal&apos;s Wager, Proper basis, Teleological, Transcendental, and Witness.
</p>

<p>Table 8.1 collects &mdash; and responds to &mdash; a selection of important arguments for god. Its first 2 are active fields of research today. The next 4 are those of Thomas Aquinas, the medieval ecstatic whose <cite>Summa Theologica</cite> remains the mainstay of Catholic theology. This an odd choice, because Aquinas himself abandoned the <cite>Summa</cite> after a vision of which he said, &lsquo;Such secrets have been revealed to me that all I have written now appears to be of little value&rsquo;. This impression is a characteristic result of temporal-lobe seizures. As I see it, Thomas had a bicameral moment in which his subconscious, which had been mulling over his work, got through to him and <a class="fn">set him straight°.<span>
	R Joseph (2001) &lsquo;The Limbic System And The Soul: Evolution and the Neuroanatomy of Religious Experience&rsquo; <cite>Zygon</cite> <b>36</b>: 105-136.
</span></a> This revelation presumably passed the same traditional test for genuineness as those of the <cite>Summa</cite> (ie, they made Thomas a &lsquo;better person&rsquo;) &mdash; so why weren&apos;t these final secrets seized on as the ultimate word of god? History might have been very different!

	This is an odd definition. Examples of my &lsquo;innate, natural desires&rsquo; are those triggered by hunger and thirst, and are easily satisfied. Does the wish for &lsquo;a political candidate who needn&apos;t be selected as the lesser of 2 evils&rsquo; qualify?

<p>The most easily understood argument <i>for</i> god &mdash; the Argument from Design &mdash; is seldom made by <a class="fn">professional designers°,<span>
	Just to suggest that this is not ivory-tower pontification, I have, in the course of a mottled career*, designed and built one-of-a-kind woodworking machines, specialized agricultural harvesters, fiberglass-making machinery, airplane-construction tools, image analyzers, miscellaneous electronic devices, particle sizing and counting equipment, continuous-diffusion cloud chambers, laser dopplermeters, physicochemical oceanographic experiments, world ocean-atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> models, and assorted software, all incidental to making a living.

	* &lsquo;To know only one thing well is to have a barbaric mind&rsquo; &mdash; Robert Graves.
</span></a> because design is nearly always evolutionary trial and error, adapting a working system whenever it can. Watch the design of a Formula 1 car during the season. Every race leads to changes &mdash; and looking back in time, F1 cars are direct descendants of the sports car, horseless carriage, wagon, wheelbarrow, and travois. I know of only one complex machine which was designed <i>in toto</i>, apparently without prototypes or experimentation, that worked when it was first built. Curt Herzstark was in a Nazi concentration camp, and needed a purpose to survive. He chose the challenge of minimizing the adding machine, and he succeeded, designing a pepper-mill sized mechanical calculator on scraps of paper. The 604-piece pilot model, hand-made after the war, worked on its first trial. Known as the Curta calculator, it was sold from 1947 to 1970, and I and every industrial designer I worked with lusted after one. The catch is that Herzstark&apos;s prior career had involved designing, testing, redesigning, and eventually optimizing 25-pound desktop adding machines.

<p>In <cite>The Guide for the Perplexed</cite> (c. 1150 CE), Maimonides set forth 25 &lsquo;propositions which are employed in the proof for the existence of God&rsquo;. Some are purely metaphysical (undecidable), suitable only for word games. Some are influenced by the curious motion of planets, resolved by Copernican heliocentricity and Newtonian physics. Some are confused approaches to mechanics, General Relativity, infinite set theory, the invisible fields of physics, and other problems which have been answered by science. In other words, nearly everything that was not understood was attributed to god. This is still the case: god lives in the ever narrowing gaps of Fig. 8.1. Leibniz pointed out that the &lsquo;god of the gaps&rsquo; was only a gap in our understanding.

<p>&lsquo;The problem of evil&rsquo; is the question of why a benevolent god permits bad things to happen to good people. One variety of evil is natural, <b>terrible and random</b>, unless karma is at work. Karma might be applicable to individual cancer; it is hard to see how it applies to, say, Japan&apos;s combination of earthquake, tsunami, and multiple nuclear catastrophes at Fukushima in March 2011. Another variety of evil is man-made, <b>terrible and non-random</b> &mdash; democide, fascism, jihad, habitat destruction, ignorance, inequality, kleptocracy, overpopulation, the Shoah, species extinctions, teratogenic munitions, terrorism, torture, <a class="fn">world hunger°.<span>
	If these things happened on my benevolent watch, I would respond with selective lightning bolts; therefore I am not made in the ethical image of the Abrahamic god, who continues to allow these evils to go unpunished even after they are called to his attention.
</span></a> Both varieties of evil are consistent with Instinct-1 and the absence of a theist god. The &lsquo;problem of evil&rsquo; is an imaginary dilemma created by our wish for rational, benevolent gods.

	Thomas Aquinas, <cite>Summa Theologica</cite>, II/II, Q.1, art. 2.

</span></a> for the half-educated mind in the second century&rsquo;. The Gnostics relied on revelation to describe the structure of the godhead, receiving this 8-generation polytheism, replete with symbolism and hidden meanings. Connecting lines represent &lsquo;emanations&rsquo;. Common to all variants of Gnosticism is the idea that matter is fundamentally evil, so that the material universe cannot be the creation of the Supreme Good God, but of the Demiurge YHVH, who was an illicit emanation. The response of the Supreme Father was to emanate two &lsquo;salvation&rsquo; Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, sent to rescue Adam&apos;s descendants from the &lsquo;sin&rsquo; of material existence and return them to the pure spirituality of the Pleroma. Plotinus long ago pointed out the problems with Gnostic revelations in his treatise <i>Against the Gnostics</i>: &lsquo;They fooled many<i>,</i> who fooled themselves first&rsquo;.

<p>On the other hand, gnosticism is the only Abrahamic theology which admits women on an equal basis with men. Considering the emphatic denial of this point by all of the other Abrahamic religions, this may be why gnosticism was so anxiously suppressed. The Catholics did such a hatchet job on it that the only way to reconstruct Fig. 8.2 is from Tertullian&apos;s attack on it.
</p>

<p>So we have to ask: Is it more likely that
</p>

<ul>
<li> A benevolent god would reveal this complex polytheism to the gnostics, knowing that it would inspire the Catholics to exterminate them &mdash; or that</li>
<li> Revelation is unique to, and produced by, the prophet, and that Aquinas&apos;s explanation of revelatory disconnects is another way of describing this.</li>

<p>Think how much misery could have been averted if Coyotl had revealed, 30,000 years ago or earlier:
</p>

<blockquote>Very small things live in wounds and in day-old food. These are bad for you. Boil wood ash and animal fat together in wine to make a slippery material which will clean them out of wounds. They can also be killed by heat, so reheat leftovers. Melt sand and wood ash together to make a stone you can see through. A smooth disc of this, thinner toward the edges and polished, will let you see small things better. Light rays come from the sun, bounce off objects and enter the eye; the transparent stone bends them. You can (and should) discover rules which will help you see more.

<p>One paragraph of elementary bacteriology, chemistry, optics, and encouragement would have prevented untold suffering and millennia of fumbling, and gotten the exponential growth of science going well before the Pharaohs. Instead, the basic message of revelation is always &lsquo;feed and obey the priests if you want to avoid an eternity of pain&rsquo;. <i>Cui bono</i>?

<p>When it comes to the ultimate size of the universe, Lucretius got it exactly right in 60 BCE:
</p>

<blockquote>Since you must admit that there is nothing outside the universe, it can have no limit and is accordingly without end or measure. It makes no odds in which part of it you may take your stand; whatever spot anyone may occupy, the universe stretches away from him just the same in all directions without limit.
</blockquote>

<p>We don&apos;t see this from earth, but instead see the inside of the ever expanding sphere of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), &lsquo;visible&rsquo; only to radio telescopes. Others outside our range of vision see a similar sphere of CMB, as in Fig. 8.4. Cosmos 6 &mdash; our current understanding &mdash; is infinite in size.
</p>

<p>Three of the important parameters of our universe are mass density, curvature, and expansion rate, represented by the 3 Ωs of Fig. 8.4. Recent cosmological observations have put constraints on all 3, as indicated by the colored areas of the triangular graph. &lsquo;CMB&rsquo; is a constraint from the Cosmic Microwave Background; &lsquo;SN&rsquo; from the distance to supernovas, and &lsquo;clusters&rsquo; from the dynamics of galactic clusters. It appears that our universe has ordinary flat (Euclidean) geometry; that it does not contain enough mass to stop expanding and recollapse; and that its rate of expansion is <i>increasing</i>, driven by &lsquo;dark energy&rsquo;, a sort of negative gravity, not yet understood.
</p>

<p>Cosmos 6 is the &lsquo;ΛCDM concordance&rsquo; universe, where Λ (lambda) is Einstein&apos;s cosmological constant and CDM is Cold Dark Matter. This has become the Standard Cosmological Model, with 6 parameters: the cosmological constant, the cold dark matter density, the baryon density, and 3 other more obscure values.

Every observer sees a different spherical universe with himself at the center. The white circle in Fig. 8.4, with the Earth at its center, is the farthest distance we can see, limited by the time since the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe. At the outer edge all we see is the CMB of photons which first escaped from the Big Bang 300,000 years after it banged. We continue to see them because older, cooler photons keep arriving as the visible edge expands.

What we see at A might be small galaxies forming gravitationally bound clusters and colliding to create large galaxies like our own Milky Way. Similarly, astronomers at A see what was happening here 7 billion years ago. &lsquo;Now&rsquo; becomes a very slippery concept at extra-galactic distances. A viewer at A sees a spherical Cosmos 5 just as we do, but in the blue crescent, he sees galaxies whose formation we will watch much later, while the white crescent is hidden behind his CMB. Observers at B and C see a CMB surface statistically like the one we see, but they cannot see us, just as we cannot see them.

<p>WMAP, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite, has spent 7 years mapping the small temperature differences of the cosmic microwave background, finding nothing that disagrees with the concordance model. An interesting discovery made by Lyman Page of WMAP is that Stephen Hawking&apos;s initials are written on the CMB equator, as shown in Fig. 8.5. This is either a clear message left by Coyotl 13.7 Gyr ago to tell us that Hawking&apos;s description of the creation of the universe is correct, or it is an example of the low-probability events routinely found in random data by <a class="fn"><i>a posteriori</i> analysis°,<span>
	<i>A posteriori</i> analysis means that no one was looking for Hawking&apos;s initials when the WMAP satellite went up. Only if the WMAP mission were designed to find &lsquo;SH&rsquo; in the data could finding it be considered significant. There are thousands of signals that would be as interesting as &lsquo;SH&rsquo;, including &lsquo;AE&rsquo; and &lsquo;CS&rsquo; (for Einstein and Sagan), or any other cosmologist, or BFB, or anything you want.

<p>The consistent position of revelatory prophets is that they (and their hearers) are exceptional, being blessed by a god with particular care and attention. This belief got us the Dark Ages and the stagnation of Hinduism and Islam. <i>All</i> scientific, and thus technical, progress has been made by assuming that we and our surroundings are average, mediocre, and part of a statistically uniform boring milieu (with occasional moments of interest and terror). All social progress has been made by admitting &mdash; however reluctantly &mdash; that despite our private claims to hope and glory, we are cosmically indistinguishable and perhaps not even an advance on bonobos.
</p>

<p>The cosmological flow of Fig. 8.7 emphasizes the problem of scale and overwhelming impression of mediocrity. If our galaxy weren&apos;t labelled and arbitrarily placed at (0,0), could you even tell whether we were on the map or among the 80% omitted to reduce clutter? Given a map of our galaxy, could you find our tame star? Yet there are those who think that some god worries when they don&apos;t pray to it properly.
</p>

<p>From Allah to Zeus, our gods were designed to explain the pocket cosmos of <a href="../_A/A04.shtml#F4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>, when all that moved was a handful of planets (often described as gods themselves). It was conceivable then that one tribal god could overwhelm the others and grant his people hegemony over the pocket. (This is still the summit of Allah&apos;s ambitions, and he wants us as slaves for his jihad armies to eke out his rather weak concept of omnipotence. YHVH was smart enough to realize that he needed <i>intellectual</i> help to do even that much, and taught his tribe to value education.) Still, control over an indistinguishable dot in Fig. 8.7 smacks of the big-frog/small-pond syndrome.

 Such a limited outlook is simple arrogance in the face of Figs. 8.6 and 8.7.

<p>The white circle of Fig. 8.4 represents our &lsquo;Hubble volume&rsquo;, the universe out to the CMB shortly after the Big Bang. It is of interest because it contains everything that we can interact with in any physical sense. It is a finite volume, and so could contain only a finite number of elementary particles. There is only a finite number of ways of arranging a finite number of particles &mdash; but Cosmos 6 in infinite in extent. We have seen above something of the complexity inside any one of the white circles of Fig. 8.4, and the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"> Observable Universe</a> will provide an entry to filling out the details inside the Hubble volume. Now we want to think about what is outside that volume.
</p>

<p>The number of nucleons (protons plus neutrons) in our Hubble volume is about N<sub>H</sub> = 10<sup>80</sup>. The number of different ways of arranging N<sub>H</sub> particles in a Hubble volume V<sub>H</sub> is large, even very large, but still finite, but only a small fraction will be stable, functioning systems. Among these will be arrangements that include exact copies of you (the difference lying elsewhere in the universe), so that even in our own patch you have many duplicates. In fact, there is a continuum of arrangements that slowly morph you into every other person on the planet. Some of these twins and near twins will have made the choices that you did not.

<p><a class="fn">Max Tegmark°<span>
	M Tegmark (2003) Parallel Universes. <cite>Scientific American</cite> <b>288</b>(#5): 31-41.
</span></a> points out that there are other patches outside of ours &mdash; quite far away, perhaps &mdash; that duplicate the particle arrangements in ours. In short, there are an infinite number of &lsquo;yous&rsquo;, many of whom have life histories that parallel yours up to a particular branch point, where they made an alternate choice. The ensemble &lsquo;you&rsquo; has tried, and lived, all possible lives available to it.
</p>

<p>This has odd philosophical consequences. Whatever difficult character-building ethical choices you may have made, whatever selfless sacrifices for the benefit of others, whatever altruistic services you may have performed, were <i>not</i> made by one or another of your doppelgangers. Do your spiritual rewards for good behavior outweigh their materialistic rewards for selfishness? Is social justice at work for the ensemble, if not for individuals?

<p>My background as a physical chemist suggests an obvious improvement over the one-shot approach of Fig. 8.8. Non-chemists will need to look at the <a href="https://iasmania.com/environmental-chemistry-fractional-distillation-of-crude-oil/">diagram</a>

How this fits into Tegmark&apos; multiple-worlds scheme (next section) remains to be worked out.

<p>Level III is Hugh Everett&apos;s universe in which every decision splits the world, so that both options are followed. It sounds crazy, and people tried to ignore it or get rid of it for 40 years, but over the last decade it has received grudging acceptance.
</p>

<p>Bizarrely, Cosmos 7 still does not exhaust the set of multiverses. The major conundrum of quantum mechanics is that our most precise mathematical description of the world presents an odd problem: the more one learns about it, the less understandable it becomes. The &lsquo;Copenhagen Interpretation&rsquo; led to the suspicion that measurement by a conscious observer was responsible for creating reality. (This idea gained acceptance by resonating strongly with mainstream anthropocentric religions that see humans as the principal reason for the universe.)  Recognizing that this was the result of an inappropriate casting of Schrödinger&apos;s equation, Hugh Everett III, a student of John Wheeler&apos;s at Princeton, suggested that the observer logically had to be included as part of the system. The resulting equations allowed the conscious measuring entity to bifurcate, along with the world containing the measurement, resulting in an ever proliferating number of parallel worlds. Everett <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/">claimed</a> that this was &lsquo;the only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and <a class="fn">the appearance of the world&rsquo;°<span>
	One reason for the lack of development of Everett&apos;s approach is that when Everett met Neils Bohr (&lsquo;the father of Copenhagen quantum mechanics&rsquo;), there was no meeting of minds: the Copenhagen group felt that Everett was unable to understand quantum mechanics. Snubbed, Everett soon left the field for the upper levels of the defense industry, starting companies, inventing new statistical methods, and becoming a millionaire.
</span></a> The state of the art is that &lsquo;If no new physics will be found to apply somewhere between apparatus and observer, we may <a class="fn" href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~as3/EssenceOfDecoherence.html">have to accept<span>
	HD Zeh (2011) &lsquo;The Essence of the Concept of Decoherence&rsquo; [Click for more, as of 2015-11-25, but it may not help.]
</span></a> the &ldquo;many worlds&rdquo; interpretation&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>The Everett &lsquo;many-worlds&rsquo; interpretation of quantum mechanics brings us to Cosmos-8, in which an infinite number of parallel words split off from ours at <a class="fn">decision points.<span>
	BS DeWitt, N Graham (1986) <cite>The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</cite> (Princeton U. P., Princeton NJ).
</span></a> These new worlds of this manifestly ridiculous concept quietly inhabit multidimensional Hilbert space, making Cosmos-8 doubly infinite (since Cosmos-7&apos;s Level-I Hubble volumes contain infinitely many copies of our volume), but otherwise adding no new features to Cosmos 6. Philosophically, Everett-bifurcations allow us to work out all of the karmic consequences of every choice we <i>didn&apos;t</i> take in this world,
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
in a manner no revelation has suggested nor any theologian pursued.
</p>

<p>Absurd as the idea seems, the equations allow it, and what the equations allow, seems to happen. A problem with trying to make this idea seem reasonable is that although the mathematics works, no verbal explanation I have seen is free of logical impasses. One may accept the idea that his own decision bifurcates his world, and that someone else&apos;s decision might do so also &mdash; <b>somewhere there&apos;s a world in which she didn&apos;t change her mind, and we lived </b><a class="fn"><b>happily ever after.</b><span>
	And now <i>the</i> existential question becomes, &lsquo;Why am I not in <i>that</i> world?’.
</span></a> Still, it seems a little excessive for <i>your</i> decision to order fettucini instead of linguini to bifurcate <i>my</i> world. Furthermore, because chaos generates wildly different results from microscopic differences in inputs, the proverbial flap of a butterfly&apos;s wing will generate millions of worlds in which the resulting hurricane produces minor differences in the distribution of human misery. What is the lower limit of event importance
	<a href="../_A/A00.shtml#14"><img class="im" src="../Images/K-Research3.gif" alt="Research"></a>
that results in a split? A Neolithic horned lizard missed an ant he might have eaten: How many worlds has that event led to?</p>

<p>The discovery of multiverses resulted from efforts to understand how our own universe could come into being without magic. Fundamentalists object that they are an imaginary device to wiggle out of admitting that a god created the universe. By magic. This is not the case. In 1930, long before multiverses were thought of, <a class="fn">R.A. Fisher<span>
	RA Fisher (1930) <cite>The Genetics of Natural Selection</cite>. (Oxford University Press, Oxford): ix.
</span></a> explained why biologists should take an interest in mathematics:</p>

<blockquote>The ordinary mathematical procedure in dealing with any actual problem is, after abstracting what are believed to be the essential elements of the problem, to consider it as one of a system of possibilities infinitely wider than the original, the essential relations of which may be apprehended by generalized reasoning, and subsumed in generalized formulae, which may be applied at will to any particular case considered.
</blockquote>

<p>Multiverses result when cosmologist follow Fisher&apos;s procedure. Multiverses also explain the appearance of fine tuning in ours, the &lsquo;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in describing the world&rsquo;, and answer the Wheeler-Hawking question, &lsquo;Why <i>these</i> equations, and not others?’ These are major philosophical successes which we cannot pursue here. <a class="fn">Tegmark<span>

</p>

<p>The real problem is semantic: Calling 2 things by the same name does not make them identical. If Cosmos-8 was created by something called G-D, then
</p>

<p class="cen"><b>YHVH : G-D :: Cosmos-1 : Cosmos-8</b>
</p>

<p class="flu">The concept described as YHVH in the Torah and incorporated into the Paulist Trinity as god the father bears the same relation to G-D as the flat-earth of Cosmos 1 bears to the multiverse. Indeed, as seen in <a href="#F8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>, there are those who place YHVH in the 6th generation from the real god. What is least likely to be shared in the above relation are the very characteristics that we prize in our Sabbath gods: accessibility, concern, response, lovingkindness. The 3 Ωs around the graph of Cosmos 6 are mathematical equations, which may be the real Trinity. If, as physicists like Max Tegmark suspect, only those &lsquo;things&rsquo; that can be <a class="fn">described mathematically<span>

</p>

<p>Most devotees of scriptural gods are unlikely to appreciate the gods revealed by physics. It seems likely that if the universe contains one god that differs in any appreciable way from an equation, it contains a hierarchy of them. Without polytheism, there is no one to fill the supportive, supervisory, YHVH-sized role that we want our tribal gods to perform.

<p>Throughout the animal world (and even among some plants), parental care of infants is the rule. When we really need someone to look after us, natural selection has provided help. This is equally true of psychosocial help. As we organized our various levels of society, we found suitable supernatural help at every stage. When society needed gods, we had them, and there was no question of their reality. They were obvious.
</p>

<p><i>Society</i> has not needed gods since the Axial Age (otherwise, they would still be around and we wouldn&apos;t be thinking up proofs of their existence). Unfortunately, natural selection is devoid of forethought. We developed pothodoxy because there was a long period when belief was the currency that bought the protection of the group, and people who asked too many pointed questions were not welcome.
</p>

<p>There will always be <i>individuals</i> who need gods to help them through life&apos;s difficult moments. Others settle for psychoactive chemicals. <i>De gustibus non est disputandem.</i> There are still groups who think you should believe what they believe. This is acceptable if:
</p>


<ul>
<li> Their advertizing is low key</li>

<li> They have demonstrated something worth looking into,</li>
</ul>


<p class="flu">but unacceptable active evil if they want to impose &lsquo;belief&rsquo; by force. The bottom line here is that if we still needed gods, they would be evident. They would not have to be taken &lsquo;on faith&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>As for the <i>universe&apos;s</i> need for a god, 250 years of intensive investigation have turned up little in the natural world that cannot be satisfactorily explained by natural processes. What lies behind the natural processes is more subtle, but we‘re working on it.

<p>The unanswerable counter argument to the existence of a god is Rachel&apos;s, because a casuist can waffle his way around the others. Autonomy does not sit well with systems like Islam that require submission to theocratic dogma and abnegation of individual ethical thinking, but that is a defect of theocracy, not of Rachel&apos;s argument. An ethical agent is autonomous, self-directing, and makes her own decisions about right and wrong. This is the essence of humanity; to abandon autonomy is to negate the point of human existence. <a class="fn">Rachels&apos;s<span>

</p>

<blockquote>The catch is that we cannot determine whether some being is God without first checking on whether he is perfectly good; and we cannot decide whether he is perfectly good without knowing (among other things) whether his commands to us are right. Thus our own judgement that some actions are right and others wrong is logically prior to our recognition of any being as God.
</blockquote>

<p>This explains how gods like <a class="fn">Kali<span>

<a class="tri" href="#18">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p class="epi">Any axiomatic system allows questions which cannot be answered without expanding the axiomatic base. &mdash; paraphrase of Kurt Gödel
</p>

<p>Gödel&apos;s theorem is couched in formal terms, and may not seem relevant to the real world, so let us frame an example. Consider Paleolithic life &mdash; to which our brain is still attuned. Its axioms were fine for dealing with saber-tooth cats, but not for all the questions that could be raised. &lsquo;Is fire good?’ is a valid Paleolithic question, and has ambivalent Paleolithic answers: &lsquo;good&rsquo; confined in a hearth; &lsquo;bad&rsquo; loose in a dry landscape. This much leads to teaching our children not to play with fire in the dry landscape of a house. So far, so good.
</p>

<p>The contemporary question of fire&apos;s &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; in heating a house can be asked by people equipped only with Paleolithic axioms &mdash; but cannot be answered by them. To answer, we must expand the axiomatic base to include the laws of thermodynamics, radiation, ocean chemistry, economics, sociology, &amp;c &mdash; for which the Paleolithic brain is unprepared. So we still burn fuel oil, converting the precious chemical free energy of reduced carbon in petroleum to its least thermodynamically valuable form of heat. This is a straightforward example: we know the original axioms; we ask a question based upon them; they give us no way to answer the question; therefore we must expand the axiomatic base. Fortunately, we have already done this, and can give qualified answers: Burning petroleum is &lsquo;Useful&rsquo; if we apply only our current sociological axioms and 90-day economics, but &lsquo;Incredibly stupid&rsquo; if we include thermodynamics, radiation, geochemistry, climate science, and long-range economics.
</p>

<p>The reason that we cannot definitively answer such questions as the existence of god and the afterlife is that the axioms introduced to support the theological answers have been falsified by advances in other fields. Scientific instruments are now sufficiently accurate, and commonplace, to have detected the activity of a theist god (the sort that takes an active role in human affairs) if there were one. The deist god (who observes but does not tinker) is undetectable, and thus undecidable.
</p>

<a class="tri" href="#19">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>Arguments about god&apos;s existence will convince no-one, or the question would have been settled long ago. We should perhaps wonder whether we are asking the right question. Perhaps a better one would be, &lsquo;How do god&apos;s commands help us create an Eirenic and Gaian society&rsquo; The gods of the major monotheisms have done little here, although Zoroaster and the rabbis tried hard, and even Paul and Muhamad recognized the need to make gestures in this direction.
</p>

<p>&lsquo;Existence&rsquo; may be the wrong question for another reason also, because the historical trend seems to be moving toward questioning the <i>nature</i> of god. Consider:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Theism&apos;s gods were &lsquo;personal&rsquo;, judgemental, and intervened in the affairs of people;</li>

<li>Deism&apos;s god was remote, judgemental, but did not tinker;</li>

<li>Pascal&apos;s <i>deus absconditus</i> wandered off and left us to our own devices;</li>

<li>The god of cosmologists seems to limit his activity to writing equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trend here might be pointing to the ultimate question, of the form:
</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Did god <i>write</i> the equations, or is she the equations themselves?&rsquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>The last option would at least explain how god can simultaneously be both &lsquo;wholly other&rsquo; and &lsquo;immanent&rsquo;.

<a href="#TOC"   id="19"> Free Will </a>
<a class="tri" href="#20">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>One feels obliged to say something about free will simply because the question has been bandied about since &lsquo;the beginning of philosophical thought&rsquo;, as Wikipedia puts it. The fear is that &lsquo;determinism&rsquo; &mdash; the idea that science has removed free will by showing the universality of cause and effect &mdash; frees us from moral responsibility for our choices: Given this, that, and the other prior events, we are unable to arrive at any but a predetermined conclusion.</p>

<p>This may be literally true, yet the adage that &lsquo;Morning is wiser than evening&rsquo; is experimental evidence for free will. It recognizes that the brain is fatigued at the end of the day, has accumulated toxins, and will make poor decisions. Let it sleep, sort through the day&apos;s experiences and memories and file them, and do all the housekeeping tasks that a Unix computer does at 0300 hrs every morning &mdash; and when it wakes, bright-eyed and bushy tailed, it will make better decisions. This may still be determinism of a sort, but it relies on the cumulative statistical-mechanical effects of thousands of indeterminate microscopic process (such as the diffusion of molecules), which are impossible to calculate or predict except statistically. A deep breath, or turning over in one&apos;s sleep, is enough to redetermine the system. The most that can be said of a completely deterministic universe is that it presents probabilities.

<a class="tri" href="#21">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>The attentive reader may have noticed this long ago, but it can&apos;t hurt to call attention to it. In the front end papers, we introduced 3 student goddesses assigned the standard problem of creating a universe in which social justice automatically prevails: peaceable Eirene, pragmatic Peira, and imaginative Emphante. What they got instead of social justice was the Great Recurring Muddle, which bears a certain resemblance to our own approach to the problems of living. Trying to do something about the Muddle, Peira put her foot down. Imagination is all very well, but not everything that can be imagined <a class="fn">is real.<span>
	This is not an obvious conclusion. Maimonides popularized (by criticizing it) the tenth proposition of the Mutakallimīn (early Islamic &lsquo;Scholastics&rsquo; who were suspect because they made intellect the test of Quranic truth, instead of the other way around), which held that everything that is conceivable by imagination is admissible. This may be &lsquo;why&rsquo; we have Cosmos-8 (if we do): it might be large and various enough for this to be true &mdash; but it is not true in Cosmos-6.
</span></a> She and Emphante inspired Descartes to invent The Method, using all the imagination possible, but testing it by reducing it to manageable questions, solving the easy problems first, putting working pieces together, and keeping lots of notes and drawing simple pictures so that they would recognize where solved problems could be applied in other areas. This effectively divided the world of ideas into those that could be publicly verified, and those that were undecidable. Eirene then jumped on the verifiable baTOCh and selected a set that &mdash; if it didn&apos;t yet amount to social justice &mdash; at least promised to keep the experiment running long enough so that we could help with the task. What the gods can&apos;t do for us, we have to do for them. It&apos;s a 2-way process.
</p>

<p>The paradox is that one of the imaginative ideas that had to be consigned to the &lsquo;undecidable&rsquo; pile along with therbligs and Escher brackets was the existence of gods &mdash; <i>and student goddesses</i>.
</p>

<p>This is related to Gautama&apos;s description of Buddhism as useful &mdash; until you didn&apos;t need it any more. Life would be a great deal simpler if other gods could cope with this paradox and explain it to their followers. No matter how much fundamentalists currently need their obsessive-compulsive gods, this is a temporary problem not shared with everyone. As Santayana put it, those who don&apos;t learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them until they do, trapped in the cycle of rebirth.

<a class="tri" href="#20">&#9651;&emsp;&emsp;</a>
<a href="#TOC"   id="21"> Natural theology </a>
<a class="tri" href="#EN">&emsp;&emsp;&#9661;</a>
</h3>

<p>The natural theology for the universe, that best matches its structure, is a 6-level hierarchical polytheism. Since it takes 100,000 years for information to travel across a galaxy, it seems more practical to have a god on each planet, like the dinosaurs who needed a separate brain to run the hind legs and tail because communication with the head took too long. The dispersed nature of the things that gods are expected to care about (such as sentient organisms) also supports polytheism, or at least a god with a density distribution comparable to that of the organisms. The volume ratio of inhabited space to empty space is minuscule, so that nearly all of an omnipresent god serves no purpose that seems related to what we claim is its principal concern (us). The only executive functions needed throughout most of the universe are those exercized by physical fields like electromagnetism and gravity. We don&apos;t hire overpaid CEOs to sit in Antarctica with nothing to do; it seems unlikely that we could find a god with any qualifications at all who would waste his time on a similar task.
</p>

<p>The supervisory god, playing the role of

<ol>
<li> <a class="fn"><b>University President</b><span>
	What can I say? We create our gods in our own image, and I&apos;m a college professor. I confess that this toy example grants university presidents an entirely unwarranted eminence. Half of those I have met seem to have been selected to calm conservative taxpayers terrified by the thought that impressionable adolescents were being exposed to dangerous ideas (evolution, Enlightenment ideals, social equality, &hellip;).
</span></a>, and concerned with theory and equations and hoping to find a way to embed social justice in the basic parameters of a universe, has neither time nor inclination to be the caring parent-substitute of our Sabbath-gods. Each of Tegmark&apos;s 4 Levels calls for a </li>
<li> <b>Dean</b>, while galaxy is about all the average</li>
<li> <b>Department Head</b> god can handle, so there is employment for some 100 billion of them in each Hubble volume. Each occupied solar system in a galaxy will need a </li>
<li> <b>Professorial</b> god. The role of functional Sabbath-gods that we know and love is filled by</li>
<li> <b>post-docs</b>, and sectarian variety is left to</li>
<li> <b>graduate students</b>.</li></ol>


<p>This does not match the story of the front end-papers, which compressed the hierarchy in the interest of brevity. Grad students of all stripes tend to over emphasize their importance, but as shown by their behavior, none of our identified gods has been more than tribal. Indra of India encourages killing anything non-Hindu; YHVH of Israel was initially happy killing non-Israelites and dashing babies against walls; Allah of Arabia wants everyone but his own to burn in hell and fancies sex with 9-year olds; <a class="fn">Billy-Joe<span>
	Derived from YHVH; anglicized to Joe-Willy; euphonized to good-old-boy, gun-toting, gay-bashing, bible-thumping Billy-Joe.
</span></a> of the Bible Belt enjoys killing blacks when he can, but will settle for gays, Eastern liberals, West Coast hippies, and anyone with an IQ above the world mean of 88; Calvin&apos;s implacable god absurdly pre-dooms many of his own people to damnation (as does Allah). Any time a current god rises to the critical level of supra-tribal synthetic kinship that defines religion, it is not the god&apos;s initiative or that of his priests. <b>It is the product of introspective cortical thinking and loving limbic emotion arising in individuals and through them imported into the community religion, usually infuriating the elders in the process.</b>
</p>

<p>To be sure, we realize that we should give lip service to the ideal of human brotherhood &mdash; but when was the last time the world as a whole was at peace? My guess is 16,000 BCE, after we had emerged from the refugia of the Last Glacial Maximum, and before we had met our neighbors.
</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Gnostics figured most of this out long ago, and the realization gave rise to their explanation, obvious from <a href="#F8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>:

He presents the complex modal-logical chain which is the ontological argument that was presented (with variations) by Anselm, Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hegel, Platinga, and Hartshorne. Suber deduces that the argument is &lsquo;valid but unsound&rsquo;, a philosophical category which to me implies that the foundational logic of the argument is itself flawed.
</span></a> which hinges on Axiom S5 of modal logic. Modal logic is a non-standard extension of Aristotelian logic which includes the operators &lsquo;possibly&rsquo;, written &#9826;, and &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo;, written &#9634;. Axiom S5 is
</p>

<p class="cen">&#9826;P &rarr; &#9634;&#9826;P,
</p>

<p class="flu">which is to say, &lsquo;<i>possibly</i> P implies <b>necessarily</b> <i>possibly</i> P&rsquo;, or, more concretely, with P = (rain tomorrow): &lsquo;<i>possibly</i> (rain tomorrow) implies <b>necessarily</b> <i>possibly</i> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo;. This seems harmless enough, and even redundant: &lsquo;It <i>might</i> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo; implies &lsquo;It <b>must</b> <i>perhaps</i> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>So far, so good. However, Axiom S5 goes on to include the statement:
</p>

<p class="cen">&#9826;&#9634;P &rarr; &#9634;P,
</p>

<p class="flu">or &lsquo;<i>possibly</i> <b>necessarily</b> P implies <b>necessarily</b> P&rsquo;, which is absurd. &lsquo;<i>Possibly</i> <b>necessarily</b> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo; does not imply &lsquo;<b>necessarily</b> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo;, as millions of desperate farmers have learned by sad experience. &lsquo;<i>Maybe</i> it <b>must</b> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo; does not mean &lsquo;it <b>must</b> (rain tomorrow)&rsquo;. Uncertainty trumps necessity!
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/">Stanford philosophy website</a> explains:
</p>

<blockquote>The controversy can be partly resolved by recognizing that the words &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; and &lsquo;possibly&rsquo;, have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind.
</blockquote>

<p>S5 can be shown to be formally true under <i>some</i> circumstances. (E.g., when an absolute variety of necessity trumps uncertainty, as in: &lsquo;<i>possibly</i> <b>necessarily</b> (you will die someday)&rsquo; implies &lsquo;you will <b>necessarily</b> die someday&rsquo;.) This ambiguity is not
