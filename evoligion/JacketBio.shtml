<p>B. F. Becula’s expectations of society were permanently warped by formative years (0~30) in the 2 most liberal/progressive/civilized communities in the US: Berkeley and Cambridge. A high-school economic dropout, he worked at what was available (ditch digger, truck driver, welder, machinist, aircraft loftsman, machine designer, &hellip;). Driven by an abiding curiosity, he looked for answers in seminary, MIT (PhD, physical chemistry), and an academic career in thalassochemistry. The working years (30~60) taught him that science answered <i>How Come?</i> but not <i>Why?</i>, and that theology answered <i>Why?</i> from a wholly inadequate base.</p>

<p>He devoted a third of his thinking years (60~90 &hellip;) to <i>Why?</i> before (like many others) reluctantly accepting projection: gods are very like us. His professorial interpretation has them seeking experimental answers to a difficult problem, with us as colleagues/lab-rats – and vanishing when no longer needed.
</p>

<p>Descended from hereditary bards of the Lord of the Isles, Becula weaves Gravesian mythopoesis and contemporary science into an optimistic and explanatory <i>theory of religion</i>. Among his sources are the
<ul style="list-style-type:none; padding:0 0 0 5px;">
<li>evolutionary biology of Lynn Margulis,</li>
<li>primatology of Allison Jolly,</li>
<li>human ecology of Garrett Hardin,</li>
<li>psychology of Wilhelm Reich,</li>
<li>sociology of Herbert Gintis,</li>
<li>geopsychology of James DeMeo,</li>
<li>bicamerality of Julian Jaynes,</li>
<li>Gaian vision of James Lovelock,</li>
<li>Enlightenment aspirations of the Founding Fathers,</li>
<li>mathematical intuitions from Plato to Tegmark,</li>
<li>and a nod to quantum field theory</li></ul>
<p>— most of which were unknown to 200-odd earlier theories he summarizes. If some of his sources seem unlikely, he replies: ‘They had their problems, but also deep insights. The point of higher education is to learn to distinguish wheat from chaff.’</p>
