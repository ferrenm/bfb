Acronyms and Abbreviations</h2>

<dfn id=”aa”>
BP</dfn><dd>Before the Present. When used in conjunction with radiocarbon dating, before 1950.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
cgs</dfn><dd>Centimeter-gram-second, the original length-mass-time units of the metric system. Obsolescent, and replaced by the MKS, or meter-kilogram-second units of SI, the Systéme Internationale. US and UK approaches use length-force-time units (foot-pound-second), or the didactic FFF (furlong-firkin-fortnight) system used to browbeat chemical-engineering students into remembering to check units at all times (as someone forgot to do for the Mars Lander!). One furlong per fortnight is very nearly 1 centimeter per minute; a furlong is 220 yards or 201+ meters, about as far as a horse wants to pull a plow without resting.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
DIY</dfn><dd>Do It Yourself. Originally aimed at the home handyman, it is equally appropriate to theology.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
EEG</dfn><dd>Electroencephalograph, a device which measures the radial electrical potential just outside the skull, resulting from radial currents in the brain&rsquo;s pyramidal cells (within a few mm of the skull). Each electrode (of which there may be 25 or more distributed over the skull) records the mean potential of thousands to millions of cells. The most characterizable result is low frequency alternating current in the 2&ndash;100 Hz range produced by coordinated activity among many neurons.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
eRNA</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Efference RNA&rsquo;. RNA coded by eukaryote introns, putatively carrying auxiliary information which makes eukaryote DNA more efficient and versatile than prokaryote DNA.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
ESS</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Evolutionary Stable Strategy&rsquo;, a way of life which is sufficiently robust to compete successfully against innovations, as demonstrated by any long-surviving species or culture. The concept is most useful in theoretical discussions, when a gedanken strategy can be shown to be non-ESS.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
FUD</dfn><dd>A polite term for corporate bullshit, an acronym for &lsquo;Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt&rsquo;. An effective marketing ploy. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want to buy that large/fast/inexpensive computer/program/peripheral from some fly-by-night competitor, because nobody will maintain it after they go out of business; we can&rsquo;t guarantee that it won&rsquo;t crash your mainframe; and in 6 months we will have a larger/faster/cheaper version guaranteed to be compatible.&rsquo; The months roll by, the company making the large/fast/inexpensive product goes out of business for lack of sales&mdash;but the compatible product never appears. IBM may have invented the ploy, and it will forever be associated with Microsoft, but a lot of companies know how to spread it.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
G$</dfn><dd>Gigadollar. The Systéme Internationale prefix &lsquo;gīga&rsquo;, abbreviated &lsquo;G&rsquo;, stands for 10<sup>9</sup>, or 1 billion. Cf &lsquo;gigabyte&rsquo;. G$1 = M$1,000 = k$1,000,000 = $1,000,000,000</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
IC</dfn><dd>'Irreducibly Complex&rsquo;&mdash;the creationist claim that any biological mechanism which will not work if a single component is altered cannot possibly have evolved, but was designed by an Intelligent Designer. No such mechanisms are known.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
ID</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Intelligent Design&rsquo;&mdash;the creationist claim that evolution is inadequate to generate living organism, so that intelligently wielded magic was necessary.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
k$</dfn><dd>kilodollar. The Systéme Internationale prefix &lsquo;kilo&rsquo;, is from Greek chilia = 1000, so k$1 = $1,000.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
ka</dfn><dd>&lsquo;kiloannum&rsquo;. 20ka means &lsquo;20,000 thousand years ago&rsquo;. (ka = 1,000 years B.P.; ky = 1,000 years)</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
LGM</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Last Glacial Maximum&rsquo;, the 22&ndash;17 ka cold spell of OIS 4 during which Indoeuropean ethnic groups developed in separate refugia in southwestern Eurasia.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>M$</dfn><dd>Megadollar. The Systéme Internationale prefix &lsquo;mega&rsquo;, abbreviated &lsquo;M&rsquo;, stands for 10<sup>6</sup>, or 1 million. Cf &rsquo;megaherz&rsquo;. M$1 = k$1,000 = $1,000,000.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>Ma</dfn><dd>&lsquo;mega-annum&rsquo;, million years ago. See ka.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>MIC</dfn><dd>Military-Industrial-Complex, or occasionally Military-Industrial-Congressional clique. As Goebbels observed, patriotism is a dependable way to manipulate the public. Demonize a nation, and we will raise the debt limit, borrow from the bankers, and give money to the arms manufacturers and mercenaries to &lsquo;protect&rsquo; ourselves against an imaginary threat. The optimum (which has perhaps been exceeded) is for everyone to have just enough money to live on uncomfortably after the taxes that go the the MIC. <i>Hoi polloi</i> may blog about a jacquerie, but should not actually get around to organizing it. See MIC-war.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>MIC-war</dfn><dd>Direct payments (bribes) to the establishment are subject to criticism by journalists and watchdog quangos. Monies raised to counter external threats (by taxes or borrowing) are much less subject to such interference. Granted, only a fraction of the money so raised can be captured directly, but by awarding no-bid, no-audit contracts to corporations in which one owns stock, an acceptable fraction may be reclaimed without public attention. This requires the continual manufacture of enemies to work satisfactorily, but given a historically ignorant public, this has not proven difficult.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>mtDNA</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Mitochondrial DNA&rsquo;. Extranuclear DNA carried by mitochondria and transmitted by women to their offspring. Transmission of male mitochondrial DNA is exceedingly rare because the single mitochondrion of a sperm cell is normally destroyed immediately after fertilization of an ovum, which itself carries 100s of maternal mitochondria.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
MKS</dfn><dd>Meter-Kilogram-Second, the basic length-mass-time units of SI, the Systéme Internationale. A meter is a long yard, a kilogram the mass of 2 loaves of bread, or a large quart of water.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>MMPI</dfn><dd>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, a standard 567-question psychological test, initially used for diagnosis of personality disorders; later for personality analysis.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>MRCA</dfn><dd>Most Recent Common Ancestor of 2 current taxa, generally calculated from genetic differences and assumptions about the rate of mutation at the chosen sites.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
NRY</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Non-recombining Y&rsquo;. Only extremely short segments of the Y-chromosome exchange with the X at crossover. The remainder is exclusively transmitted to sons, allowing an easy way to follow the paternal line in families.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>OIS</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Oxygen Isotope Stage&rsquo;, a major time period defined by the mean oxygen-isotope composition of ice. Heavier atoms move more slowly than light ones, so light water molecules (H<sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup>O) evaporat preferentially, while heavy molecules (H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O)&mdash;the rare isotope&mdash;stays behind. If the precipitation remains frozen as land ice, seawater is gradually enriched in <sup>18</sup>O, the change is reflected in precipitation, and the changing ratio can be used to estimate ice volume.
</dd><br>

<dfn id=”pH”>
pH</dfn><dd> A measure of solution acidity: pH = -log[H<sup>+</sup>], where [H<sup>+</sup>] is the concentration of hydrogen ion. Highly basic (alkaline) solutions have pH 14, pure water is pH 7, strong acid is pH 0. Seawater is around pH 7.5, fresh water saturated with CO<sub>2</sub> is about 5.5. Strictly speaking, pH measures {H<sup>+</sup>}, the &lsquo;activity&rsquo; or &lsquo;thermodynamic concentration&rsquo; of hydrogen ion. Activity is affected by everything else in solution, and different varieties of H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive and reference electrodes give different results in different solutions. Uncertainty arises when electrode-pairs calibrated with standard buffers are used in solution containing materials not in the buffers (e.g., seawater).</dd><br>

<dfn id="aa">
SI</dfn><dd>Le Système International d'Unités, successor to the metric system, universally adopted in 1960 (and universally used, with some minor exceptions: Burma, Liberia, US, and UK, although the UK is moving along). The confusion between &lsquo;metric&rsquo; and &lsquo;Imperial&rsquo; systems is often used as proof of Coyotl&rsquo;s incompetence: if we had 4 or 6 fingers instead of 5, our basic arithmetic would be octal or duodecimal, each with specific advantages (easy conversion to binary; divisible by 3).
</dd><br>

<dfn id=”T$”>
T$</dfn><dd>&lsquo;Teradollar&rsquo;. The Systéme Internationale prefix &lsquo;tera&rsquo;, abbreviated &lsquo;T&rsquo;, stands for 10<sup>12</sup>, or 1 trillion. Cf &lsquo;terabyte&rsquo;. T$1 = G$1,000 = M$1,000,000 = k$1,000,000,000 = $1,000,000,000,000.</dd><br>

<dfn id="ag">
agnosticism</dfn><dd>The theory that the ultimate problems of philosophy and religion are undecidable because we lack means of falsifying erroneous ideas in this area.</dd><br>

<dfn id="al">
allele</dfn><dd> One of the forms of a variable gene. Eye color is specified by an allele of the eye-color gene. All hominids share the same genes. All oxygen-using organisms share suites of genes, because all use the same chemistry. Where we differ is in alleles of those genes. If there are different amino acids in protein sequences, we speak of different alleles of the gene that specifies the protein. Many such differences have no effect; some have effects that make little or no difference to the organism (eye color); yet others may improve or degrade the protein&rsquo;s performance. The single-gene disease cystic fibrosis may be caused by any of 400 different alleles of the chloride-ion transport gene. When an allele is beneficial&mdash;a potential evolutionary advance&mdash;we seldom notice. Its owner is slightly better off, but unless this benefit translates to more than the average surviving number of children, it does not contribute to evolution. Major advances thus tend to occur in small isolated inbreeding populations. Members of Eero Mäntyranta&rsquo;s extended family shared a rare allele which increased the oxygen-carrying capacity of his blood by 50%, giving him an Olympic advantage in cross-country skiing, with 7 medals 1960-80. The modification turned off a gene which itself turned off platelet production, suggesting that in some earlier situation, Eero&rsquo;s advantage was a disadvantage.</dd><br>

androphilia</dfn><dd>Intense emotional attachment between males (often a youth and man) indistinguishable from heterosexual love; Platonic love. The Classical Greek ideal, called &lsquo;paederasty&rsquo; (q.v.), was publicly asexual, with banishment or death the penalty for transgression. How far this ideal was met in private is a matter of debate.</dd><br>

bimondial</dfn><dd>Existing or acting in both planes of a dualist philosophy.</dd><br>

<dfn id="BW">
Bretton Woods instruments</dfn><dd>International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, now part of the World Bank. Publicly, the purpose of the Bretton Woods Agreements was &lsquo;a system of international payments that would allow trade to be conducted without fear of sudden currency depreciation or wild fluctuations in exchange rates&mdash;ailments that had nearly paralyzed world capitalism during the Great Depression&rsquo;. Privately, &lsquo;the US officials intended the second half of the 20th [century] to be under US hegemony&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Bretton Woods, created a system of triangular trade: the US would [&hellip;] trade at a tremendous profit with developing nations, expanding industry and acquiring raw materials. It would [&hellip;] send dollars to Europe [&hellip;] to rebuild their economies, and make the US the market for their products. This would allow the other industrialized nations to purchase products from the Third World, which reinforced the American role as the guarantor of stability. When this triangle became destabilized, Bretton Woods entered a period of crisis that ultimately led to its collapse&rsquo; {Wikipedia}. We have been &lsquo;muddling through&rsquo; since the 1970s, with temporary agreements and no dominant nation imposing its own profitable system.</dd><br>

<dfn id="aa">
calorie</dfn><dd>The cgs metric system unit of energy, being the amount needed to raise 1 gram of water 1°C. 4.186 joules. When referring to food, it means &lsquo;kilocalorie&rsquo; and should be capitalized as Calorie, indicating 1000 times as much energy. Obsolescent; replaced by the joule, which is one watt-second or newton-meter.</dd><br>

<dfn id="Cd">
carbon dating</dfn><dd>Carbon-14 emits weak beta particles (electrons), with variable energy (shared with undetectable neutrinos); it has a long halflife (ca 5730 years) so counting betas takes a long time, making background correction imprecise. The amount of <sup>14</sup>C incorporated into vegetation depends upon its production in the upper atmosphere from <sup>14</sup>N, (which is a function of solar activity and changes with time), and also upon isotope fractionation effects (light molecules react faster than heavy ones), and exchange of carbon between oceanic and atmospheric reservoirs. Calibration curves (obtained by piecing together annual series from different trees) face the problem of matching signals contaminated with noise, which can result in multiple &lsquo;high-correlation&rsquo; fits to different time periods.<br>
Archaeological samples may be contaminated by &lsquo;old&rsquo; carbon from natural oil seeps, or &lsquo;young&rsquo; carbon from bacteria and roots. Some beta counters are sensitive to the placement of the sample on a carrier, and condensed-phase samples introduce self-shielding. All of these effects affect the accuracy of radiocarbon dating.<br>
In the early 1960s, Nick Shackleton introduced mass spectrometry for carbon dating. This counts individual atoms from a gas-phase sample, and can measure carbon-12, -13, and -14 simultaneously. This approach needs much smaller samples, allows correction for isotopic fractionation, and eliminates all of the problems of beta counting. The smaller samples mean that (for an ancient text), &lsquo;paper&rsquo;, ink, and glue can all be dated separately. Background radiation no longer interferes, and the 6-halflife practical limit of beta-counting no longer prevails. Mass spectrometry can look farther back in time.<br>
Techniques improve constantly, so radiocarbon dates have improved over time. This is not, as many befuddled web pages argue, because one can obtain any desired date from radiocarbon, but because science learns how to correct its errors. Nevertheless, 50,000 years remains an elusive goal.<br>
The charge of &lsquo;obtaining any desired date&rsquo; is not entirely without foundation. Whenever reputations, pet theories, or further funding require a particular date <b>by any method</b>, samples should be counted blind (with the expected date unknown). Controversy is normal in such cases: the 14th-century date for the Shroud of Turin suffers from a lack of a &lsquo;forensic chain of evidence&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the&rsquo; sample was off camera for an appreciable period and its carrier had access to similar material known to be 14th century, and &lsquo;the&rsquo; sample was taken from an area of the linen Shroud determined later to have been mended by reweaving with younger cotton.</dd><br>

<dfn id=”aa”>
chauvinism</dfn><dd>The corrupted version of patriotism: unreasoning, bigotted, xenophobic.
</dd><br>

<dfn id="Ch">
Christological</dfn><dd>Relating to the nature of Christ. The 4th Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 decided that Christ had 2 distinct natures, human and divine, which came together harmoniously in &lsquo;hypostasic union&rsquo; (literally, &lsquo;standing under&rsquo;, but through the Latin, &lsquo;substance&rsquo;) in the person of Jesus. Since no one knew what this meant, &lsquo;Christological&rsquo; debate soon erupted in Asia Minor, ultimately leading to the separation of  Orthodox and Catholic Churches.</dd><br>

chromosome</dfn><dd>A linear polymer of DNA containing information describing an individual organism. Like snowflakes, no 2 chromosomes are exactly alike, despite the best efforts of the replication and error-correction process.</dd><br>

<dfn id="chr">
chronospecies</dfn><dd>When speciation is by accumulation of small mutations, there is no definite demarcation in time. The spottiness of the fossil record will often reveal distinctly different members of the continuum (as for horses in the New World, each species representing a new invasion from Asia, where change was slow, steady, and cumulative). <i>Eohippus, Mesohippus, </i>and<i> Equus</i> are chronospecies.</dd><br>

clitoridectomy</dfn><dd>also called &lsquo;excision&rsquo;, &lsquo;female genital mutilation&rsquo; (FGM), and&mdash;misleadingly&mdash;female circumcision, this is removal of all or part of the clitoris, customarily without benefit of antiseptic, anaesthetic, or a sharp knife. Mohammed thought it a good idea.</dd><br>

Wilson (1998)<span> <cite>Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge</cite> (Little, Brown, NY).</span></a>. A purported explanation of one topic must not conflict with explantions of another. Appreciating this requires a brain organization that minimizes compartmentalization.</dd><br>

<dfn id="aa">
conspiracy</dfn><dd>Two or more people who plan to commit an illegal act and who then take one or more specific actions in furtherance of that plan. In the absence of a meaningful investigation, all ideas about the destruction of the WTC on 9/11 are conspiracy theories; the only question is, &lsquo;By whom?&rsquo; (The FBI has no evidence linking Osama bin Laden to the event; the evidence linking Dick Cheney is persuasive.)</dd><br>

<dfn id="aa">
convergent evolution</dfn><dd>The process by which an environmental niche imposes its requirements upon an organism occupying it. The result is that unrelated species come to resemble eachother, sometimes to the point of tricking early taxonomists who necessarily depended upon phenotypic characters to identify relationships. Examples include marsupial moles, Tasmanian wolves, ichthyosaurs and dolphins, &c.</dd><br>

Coolidge Effect
<img style=" width: 33%;" class="fr" src="../Images/CoolidgeEffect.jpg" alt="../Images/CoolidgeEffect.jpg">
</dfn><dd>The alpha male&rsquo;s desire to handle all breeding within the group, expressed as an anecdote in which President Calvin Coolidge and his wife visit a poultry farm. During the tour, Mrs. Coolidge inquires of the farmer how his farm managed to produce so many fertile eggs with such a small number of roosters.The farmer explains that his roosters perform their duty dozens of times each day.<br>&lsquo;Perhaps you could point that out to Mr. Coolidge&rsquo;, replied the First Lady. The President, overhearing the remark, asked the farmer, &lsquo;Does each rooster service the same hen each time?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;No&rsquo;, answered the farmer, &lsquo;there are many hens for each rooster.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Perhaps you could point that out to Mrs. Coolidge&rsquo;, suggested the President.<br>In keeping with finding that this is a universal response across species, the rooster is replaced by a bull, ram, or stallion in other versions of the story. <a href="#" class="n">Image source.<span>W Beamer, G Bermant, M Clegg (1969) &lsquo;Copulatory Behavior of the Ram&rsquo; <cite>Animal Behavior</cite> <b>17</b>: 795&ndash;800.</span></a></dd><br>

corpperson</dfn><dd>An amoral, sociopathic, (il)legal concept created by ex-railroad president Bancroft Davis, working as a Supreme Court clerk, when he illegitimately inserted the phrase &lsquo;The defendant Corporations are persons within the intent of the clause in section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo; into the Summary of Santa Clara County vs. Southern Pacific Railroad Co., 118 US 394 (1886). The Founding Fathers had no such intent, but subsequent interpretation has given corporations Bill of Rights protection, with the result that misleading ads are called &lsquo;free speech&rsquo;, state governments cannot limit destructive corporate acts, and corporations are allowed to spend stockholder money to buy legislators and legislation. The <a href="http://www.amiba.net/news/2011-media/corporation-pro-business#ixzz2MlrwvvIq">American Independent Business Alliance</a> rejects corporate personhood on the grounds that &lsquo;large corporations have converted their economic power into political favors that extract subsidies from taxpayers, stifle enforcement of anti-trust laws&hellip;and other rules that disadvantage small business&rsquo;.</dd><br>

diploid</dfn><dd>Possessing duplicate chromosome sets, one derived from each parent. See <i>haploid</i>. Organisms that reproduce sexually alternate between diploid and haploid generations. For most organisms (ferns are an exception) the diploid generation is what we think of as &lsquo;the organisms&rsquo;, and the haploid generation is its sex cells. The purpose of diploidy (and sexual reproduction) is that it allows every individual to be genetically different, thus foiling simple parasites who can take advantage of uniformity.</dd><br>

This has been labelled <cite>Documenta Q</cite> (for German <i>Quelle</i>, source), and the Jesus Seminar has attempted to reconstruct it from the Gospels by examining what they do and do not have in common, the historical events of the late first century, and the embryonic church&rsquo;s known response to them. The <cite>Gospel of Thomas</cite>, discovered in the Qumran material, was the first confirmation that such collections existed, but it shows a heavy Gnostic influence postdating Jesus.</dd><br>

It 1960 it predicted that if the population continued the growth pattern of the last 2 millennia, it would go infinite on Friday, 13 Nov 2026, and squeeze itself to death. The authors pointed out that such singularities are common in physics, and represent a change of behavior (the water-ice transition is a singularity). Critics, missing the point, complained that such squeezing was impossible, because 1) the outer shell of an infinitely rapidly sphere of reproducing humans would increase faster than the speed of light, and 2) there were not enough resources on Earth to support such growth&mdash;which <i>was</i> the point. No one has challenged the comparison to tumor growth&mdash;whose &lsquo;singularity&rsquo; is the death of the organism and tumor. See <a href="../_E/E20.shtml#F20.16">Fig. 20.16.</a></dd><br>

genetic code</dfn><dd>Four &lsquo;letters&rsquo; constitute the DNA alphabet (A=adenine, C=cytosine, G=guanine, T=thymine, with U=uracil replacing T in RNA). These combine in triplet &lsquo;codons&rsquo; to specify amino acids in proteins. This could code for 64 amino acids, but only 20 are used. The redundancy lies in the fact that most acids are specified by the first 2 letters, with the &lsquo;3rd base&rsquo;&mdash;all the letters represent basic chemicals&mdash;being &lsquo;silent&rsquo;. Only tryptophan has a single RNA code, UGG, while leucine has 6. The coding is all but universal in living organisms, yet it appears arbitrary (ie, there is no obvious chemical or thermodynamic relation between the code and the acid coded for)&mdash;but &lsquo;we&rsquo;re working on it&rsquo;: several approaches point to clearer relations in the more primitive codes that must have preceded the current version.</dd><br>

The easiest way to generate such organisms is by crossing two highly inbred (allelically invariant) lines. F1 (first filial generation) hybrid seeds are beloved by seed companies, since the next (F2) generation segregates into 3 allelic varieties, 2 of which are homozygotic, so that farmers who need a uniform crop cannot save seed from year to year. Another way of obtaining hybrid vigor is tetraploidy (q.v.). Tetraploid seeds breed true.</dd><br>
